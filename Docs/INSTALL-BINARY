2.2. Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries

   Oracle provides a set of binary distributions of MySQL. These
   include binary distributions in the form of compressed tar files
   (files with a .tar.gz extension) for a number of platforms, as
   well as binaries in platform-specific package formats for selected
   platforms.

   This section covers the installation of MySQL from a compressed
   tar file binary distribution. For other platform-specific package
   formats, see the other platform-specific sections. For example,
   for Windows distributions, see Section 2.3, "Installing MySQL on
   Microsoft Windows."

   To obtain MySQL, see Section 2.1.3, "How to Get MySQL."

   MySQL compressed tar file binary distributions have names of the
   form mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz, where VERSION is a number (for
   example, 5.6.14), and OS indicates the type of operating system
   for which the distribution is intended (for example, pc-linux-i686
   or winx64).

   To install MySQL from a compressed tar file binary distribution,
   your system must have GNU gunzip to uncompress the distribution
   and a reasonable tar to unpack it. If your tar program supports
   the z option, it can both uncompress and unpack the file.

   GNU tar is known to work. The standard tar provided with some
   operating systems is not able to unpack the long file names in the
   MySQL distribution. You should download and install GNU tar, or if
   available, use a preinstalled version of GNU tar. Usually this is
   available as gnutar, gtar, or as tar within a GNU or Free Software
   directory, such as /usr/sfw/bin or /usr/local/bin. GNU tar is
   available from http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/.
   Warning

   If you have previously installed MySQL using your operating system
   native package management system, such as yum or apt-get, you may
   experience problems installing using a native binary. Make sure
   your previous MySQL previous installation has been removed
   entirely (using your package management system), and that any
   additional files, such as old versions of your data files, have
   also been removed. You should also check the existence of
   configuration files such as /etc/my.cnf or the /etc/mysql
   directory have been deleted.

   If you run into problems and need to file a bug report, please use
   the instructions in Section 1.7, "How to Report Bugs or Problems."

   On Unix, to install a compressed tar file binary distribution,
   unpack it at the installation location you choose (typically
   /usr/local/mysql). This creates the directories shown in the
   following table.

   Table 2.3. MySQL Installation Layout for Generic Unix/Linux Binary
   Package
   Directory Contents of Directory
   bin Client programs and the mysqld server

   lib Libraries
   scripts mysql_install_db
   share Miscellaneous support files, including error messages,
   sample configuration files, SQL for database installation
   sql-bench Benchmarks

   Debug versions of the mysqld binary are available as mysqld-debug.
   To compile your own debug version of MySQL from a source
   distribution, use the appropriate configuration options to enable
   debugging support. For more information on compiling from source,
   see Section 2.9, "Installing MySQL from Source."

   To install and use a MySQL binary distribution, the basic command
   sequence looks like this:
shell> groupadd mysql
shell> useradd -r -g mysql mysql
shell> cd /usr/local
shell> tar zxvf /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz
shell> ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql
shell> cd mysql
shell> chown -R mysql .
shell> chgrp -R mysql .
shell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
shell> chown -R root .
shell> chown -R mysql data
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
# Next command is optional
shell> cp support-files/mysql.server /etc/init.d/mysql.server

   mysql_install_db creates a default option file named my.cnf in the
   base installation directory. This file is created from a template
   included in the distribution package named my-default.cnf. For
   more information, see Section 5.1.2.2, "Using a Sample Default
   Server Configuration File."

   A more detailed version of the preceding description for
   installing a binary distribution follows.
   Note

   This procedure assumes that you have root (administrator) access
   to your system. Alternatively, you can prefix each command using
   the sudo (Linux) or pfexec (OpenSolaris) command.

   The procedure does not set up any passwords for MySQL accounts.
   After following the procedure, proceed to Section 2.10,
   "Postinstallation Setup and Testing."

Create a mysql User and Group

   If your system does not already have a user and group for mysqld
   to run as, you may need to create one. The following commands add
   the mysql group and the mysql user. You might want to call the
   user and group something else instead of mysql. If so, substitute
   the appropriate name in the following instructions. The syntax for
   useradd and groupadd may differ slightly on different versions of
   Unix, or they may have different names such as adduser and
   addgroup.
shell> groupadd mysql
shell> useradd -r -g mysql mysql

   Note

   Because the user is required only for ownership purposes, not
   login purposes, the useradd command uses the -r option to create a
   user that does not have login permissions to your server host.
   Omit this option to permit logins for the user (or if your useradd
   does not support the option).

Obtain and Unpack the Distribution

   Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the distribution
   and change location into it. The example here unpacks the
   distribution under /usr/local. The instructions, therefore, assume
   that you have permission to create files and directories in
   /usr/local. If that directory is protected, you must perform the
   installation as root.
shell> cd /usr/local

   Obtain a distribution file using the instructions in Section
   2.1.3, "How to Get MySQL." For a given release, binary
   distributions for all platforms are built from the same MySQL
   source distribution.

   Unpack the distribution, which creates the installation directory.
   Then create a symbolic link to that directory. tar can uncompress
   and unpack the distribution if it has z option support:
shell> tar zxvf /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz
shell> ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql

   The tar command creates a directory named mysql-VERSION-OS. The ln
   command makes a symbolic link to that directory. This enables you
   to refer more easily to the installation directory as
   /usr/local/mysql.

   If your tar does not have z option support, use gunzip to unpack
   the distribution and tar to unpack it. Replace the preceding tar
   command with the following alternative command to uncompress and
   extract the distribution:
shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Perform Postinstallation Setup

   The remainder of the installation process involves setting up the
   configuration file, creating the core databases, and starting the
   MySQL server. For instructions, see Section 2.10,
   "Postinstallation Setup and Testing."
   Note

   The accounts that are listed in the MySQL grant tables initially
   have no passwords. After starting the server, you should set up
   passwords for them using the instructions in Section 2.10,
   "Postinstallation Setup and Testing."

2.3. Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows

   MySQL for Microsoft Windows is available in a number of different
   forms. A Microsoft Windows operating system such as Windows Vista,
   Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2012.
   Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are supported. For supported
   platform information, see
   http://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html.

   In addition to running MySQL as a standard application, you can
   also run the MySQL server as a Windows service. By using a service
   you can monitor and control the operation of the server through
   the standard Windows service management tools. For more
   information, see Section 2.3.5.7, "Starting MySQL as a Windows
   Service."

   Generally, you should install MySQL on Windows using an account
   that has administrator rights. Otherwise, you may encounter
   problems with certain operations such as editing the PATH
   environment variable or accessing the Service Control Manager.
   Once installed, MySQL does not need to be executed using a user
   with Administrator privileges.

   For a list of limitations within the Windows version of MySQL, see
   Section E.10.6, "Windows Platform Limitations."

   In addition to the MySQL Server package, you may need or want
   additional components to use MySQL with your application or
   development environment. These include, but are not limited to:

     * If you plan to connect to the MySQL server using ODBC, you
       need a Connector/ODBC driver. For more information, including
       installation and configuration instructions, see Section 22.1,
       "MySQL Connector/ODBC." But note that MySQL Installer will
       install and configure Connector/ODBC for you.

     * If you plan to use MySQL server with .NET applications, you
       need the Connector/Net driver. For more information, including
       installation and configuration instructions, see Section 22.2,
       "MySQL Connector/Net." But note that MySQL Installer will
       install and configure Connector/NET for you.

   MySQL distributions for Windows can be downloaded from
   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/. See Section 2.1.3, "How to Get
   MySQL."

   MySQL for Windows is available in several distribution formats,
   detailed below. Generally speaking, you should use MySQL
   Installer. It is simpler to use than the ZIP file, and you need no
   additional tools to get MySQL up and running. MySQL Installer will
   automatically install MySQL Server, install additional MySQL
   products, create an options file, starts the server, and allow you
   to create default user accounts. For more information on choosing
   a package, see Section 2.3.2, "Choosing An Installation Package."

     * MySQL Installer. It includes MySQL Server and additional MySQL
       products including MySQL Workbench, MySQL Notifier, and MySQL
       for Excel. And MySQL Installer can also be used to upgrade
       these product in the future.
       For instructions on installing MySQL using MySQL Installer,
       see Section 2.3.3, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows
       Using MySQL Installer."

     * Standard binary distribution format packaged as a Zip file
       containing all of the necessary files that you unpack into
       your chosen location. This package contains all of the files
       in the full Windows MSI Installer package, but does not
       include an installation program.
       For instructions on installing MySQL using the Zip file, see
       Section 2.3.5, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a
       noinstall Zip Archive."

     * The source distribution contains all the code and support
       files for building the executables using the Visual Studio
       compiler system.
       For instructions on building MySQL from source on Windows, see
       Section 2.9, "Installing MySQL from Source."

   MySQL on Windows considerations:

     * Large Table Support
       If you need tables with a size larger than 4GB, install MySQL
       on an NTFS or newer file system. Do not forget to use MAX_ROWS
       and AVG_ROW_LENGTH when you create tables. See Section
       13.1.17, "CREATE TABLE Syntax."

     * MySQL and Virus Checking Software
       Using virus scanning software such as Norton/Symantec
       Anti-Virus on directories containing MySQL data and temporary
       tables can cause issues, both in terms of the performance of
       MySQL and the virus-scanning software mis-identifying the
       contents of the files as containing spam. This is because of
       the fingerprinting mechanism used by the virus scanning
       software, and the way in which MySQL rapidly updates different
       files, which may be identified as a potential security risk.
       After installing MySQL Server, it is recommended that you
       disable virus scanning on the main directory (datadir) being
       used to store your MySQL table data. There is usually a system
       built into the virus scanning software to permit certain
       directories to be specifically ignored during virus scanning.
       In addition, by default, MySQL creates temporary files in the
       standard Windows temporary directory. To prevent the temporary
       files also being scanned, you should configure a separate
       temporary directory for MySQL temporary files and add this to
       the virus scanning exclusion list. To do this, add a
       configuration option for the tmpdir parameter to your my.ini
       configuration file. For more information, see Section 2.3.5.2,
       "Creating an Option File."

2.3.1. MySQL Installation Layout on Microsoft Windows

   For MySQL 5.6 on Windows, the default installation directory is
   C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6. Some Windows users prefer
   to install in C:\mysql, the directory that formerly was used as
   the default. However, the layout of the subdirectories remains the
   same.

   All of the files are located within this parent directory, using
   the structure shown in the following table.

   Table 2.4. Default MySQL Installation Layout for Microsoft Windows
   Directory Contents of Directory Notes

   installation

   If you install MySQL using the MySQL Installer, this package
   creates and sets up the data directory that the installed server
   will use, and also creates a pristine "template" data directory
   named data under the installation directory. After an installation
   has been performed using this package, the template data directory
   can be copied to set up additional MySQL instances. See Section
   5.6, "Running Multiple MySQL Instances on One Machine."

2.3.2. Choosing An Installation Package

   For MySQL 5.6, there are installation package formats to choose
   from when installing MySQL on Windows:

     * MySQL Installer: This package has a file name similar to
       mysql-installer-community-5.6.14.0.msi or
       mysql-installer-commercial-5.6.14.0.msi, and utilizes MSI's to
       automatically install MySQL server and other products. It will
       download and apply updates to itself, and for each of the
       installed products. It also configures the additional
       non-server products.
       The installed products are configurable, and this includes:
       documentation with samples and examples, connectors (such as
       C, C++, J, NET, and ODBC), MySQL Workbench, MySQL Notifier for
       Microsoft Windows, MySQL for Excel, and the MySQL Server with
       its components.
       MySQL Installer will run on all Windows platforms that are
       supported by MySQL
       (http://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html
       ). Note: because MySQL is not a native component of Windows
       and depends on .NET, it will not work on minimal installation
       options like the "Server Core" version of Windows Server 2008.
       For instructions on installing MySQL using MySQL Installer,
       see Section 2.3.3, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows
       Using MySQL Installer."

     * The Noinstall Archive: This package has a file name similar to
       mysql-5.6.14-win32.zip or mysql-5.6.14-winx64.zip, and
       contains all the files found in the Complete install package,
       with the exception of the GUI. This package does not include
       an automated installer, and must be manually installed and
       configured.

   Your choice of install package affects the installation process
   you must follow. If you choose to use MySQL Installer, see Section
   2.3.3, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using MySQL
   Installer." If you choose to install a Noinstall archive, see
   Section 2.3.5, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a
   noinstall Zip Archive."

2.3.3. Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using MySQL Installer

   MySQL Installer is an application that simplifies the installation
   and updating process for a wide range of MySQL products, including
   MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows, MySQL Workbench, and MySQL
   for Excel. From this central application, you can see which MySQL
   products are already installed, configure them, and update or
   remove them if necessary. The installer can also install plugins,
   documentation, tutorials, and example databases. The MySQL
   Installer is only available for Microsoft Windows, and includes
   both a GUI and command-line interface.

Installer package types


     * Full: Bundles all of the MySQL products (including MySQL
       Server). The file is over 160MB, and have names of the form
       mysql-installer-community-VERSION.N.msi where VERSION is the
       MySQL Server version number such as 5.6 and N is the package
       number, which begins at 0.

     * Web: Only contains the Installer and configuration files, and
       it only downloads the MySQL products you choose to install.
       The file is about 2MB, and have names of the form
       mysql-installer-community-web-VERSION.N.msi where VERSION is
       the MySQL Server version number such as 5.6 and N is the
       package number, which begins at 0.

Installer editions


     * Community edition: Downloadable at
       http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/. It installs the
       community edition of all MySQL products.

     * Commercial edition: Downloadable at either My Oracle Support
       (https://support.oracle.com/) (MOS) or
       https://edelivery.oracle.com/. It installs the commercial
       version of all MySQL products, including Workbench SE. It also
       integrates with your MOS account, so enter in your MOS
       credentials to automatically receive updates for your
       commercial MySQL products.

   For release notes detailing the changes in each release of MySQL
   Installer, see MySQL Installer Release Notes
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql-installer/en/).

   MySQL Installer is compatible with pre-existing installations, and
   adds them to its list of installed components. And while the MySQL
   Installer is bundled with a specific version of MySQL Server, a
   single MySQL Installer instance can install and manage multiple
   MySQL Server versions. For example, a single MySQL Installer
   instance can install versions 5.1, 5.5, and 5.6. It can also
   manage either commercial or community editions of the MySQL
   Server.
   Note

   A single host can not have both community and commercial editions
   of MySQL Server installed. For example, if you want both MySQL
   Server 5.5 and 5.6 installed on a single host, then both must be
   the same commercial or community edition.

   MySQL Installer handles the initial configuration and setup of the
   applications. For example:

    1. It will create MySQL Server connections in MySQL Workbench.

    2. It creates the configuration file (my.ini) that is used to
       configure the MySQL Server. The values written to this file
       are influenced by choices you make during the installation
       process.

    3. It imports example databases.

    4. It creates MySQL Server user accounts with configurable
       permissions based on general roles, such as DB Administrator,
       DB Designer, and Backup Admin. It optionally creates a Windows
       user named MysqlSys with limited privileges, which would then
       run the MySQL Server.
       This feature is only available during the initial installation
       of the MySQL Server, and not during future updates. User
       accounts may also be added with MySQL Workbench.

    5. If the "Advanced Configuration" option is checked, then the
       Logging Options are also configured. This includes defining
       file paths for the error log, general log, slow query log
       (including the configuration of seconds it requires to execute
       a query), and the binary log.

   MySQL Installer can optionally check for updated components and
   download them for you automatically.

2.3.3.1. MySQL Installer GUI

   After installation of the GUI version, the installer will have add
   its own Start Menu item under MySQL.
   Note

   Files that are generated by MySQL Installer grant full permissions
   to the user that executes MySQL Installer, including my.ini. This
   does not apply to files and directories for specific products such
   as the MySQL Server data directory in ProgramData, that is owned
   by SYSTEM.

   After the installer itself has been installed and started, the
   following screen is displayed:

   Figure 2.7. MySQL Installer - Welcome Screen
   MySQL Installer - Welcome Screen

   There are three main options:

    1. Install MySQL Products - The Installation Wizard.

    2. About MySQL - Learn about MySQL products and features.

    3. Resources - Information to help install and configure MySQL.

   To Install MySQL Products after executing MySQL Installer for the
   first time, you must accept the license agreement before
   proceeding with the installation process.

   Figure 2.8. MySQL Installer - License Agreement
   MySQL Installer - License Agreement

   If you are connected to the Internet, then the Installer will
   search for the latest MySQL components and add them to the
   installation bundle. Click Connect to the Internet to complete
   this step, or otherwise check the Skip checkbox and then Continue.

   Figure 2.9. MySQL Installer - Find latest products
   MySQL Installer - Find latest products

   If you chose "Connect to the Internet," the next page will show
   the progress of MySQL Installer's search for available updates.
   When the search is complete (or if you opted to skip the search),
   you will be taken to the Choose Setup Type page:

   Figure 2.10. MySQL Installer - Choosing a Setup Type
   MySQL Installer - Choosing a Setup Type

   Determine the option most compatible with your preferences by
   reading the Setup Type Description descriptions.

   The Installation and Data paths are also defined here, and a
   caution flag will notify you if the data path you define already
   exists.

   After you select a setup type, the MySQL Installer will check your
   system for the necessary external requirements and download then
   install missing components onto your system.

   Figure 2.11. MySQL Installer - Check Requirements
   MySQL Installer - Check Requirements

   The next window lists the MySQL products that are scheduled to be
   installed:

   Figure 2.12. MySQL Installer - Installation Progress
   MySQL Installer - Installation Progress

   As components are installed, you'll see their status change from
   "to be installed" to "install success."

   Figure 2.13. MySQL Installer - Installation Progress status
   MySQL Installer - Installation Progress status

   After all components are installed, the next step involves
   configuring the products. The Configuration Overview window
   displays the progress and then loads a configuration window if it
   is required.

   Figure 2.14. MySQL Installer - Configuration Overview
   MySQL Installer - Configuration Overview

   The ideal MySQL Server configuration depends on your intended use,
   as explained in the next window. Choose the description that most
   closely applies to your machine.

   You may enable TCP/IP Networking here as otherwise only localhost
   connections are allowed.

   Checking the "Advanced Configuration" option provides additional
   Logging Options to configure. This includes defining file paths
   for the error log, general log, slow query log (including the
   configuration of seconds it requires to execute a query), and the
   binary log.

   Figure 2.15. MySQL Installer - MySQL Server Configuration: Define
   platform, networking, and logging options
   MySQL Installer- MySQL Server Configuration: Define platform,
   networking, and logging options

   Next, choose your account information. Defining a root password is
   required, whereas it's optional to create additional users. There
   are several different predefined user roles that each have
   different permission levels. For example, a "DB Admin" will have
   more privileges than a "DB Designer.".

   Figure 2.16. MySQL Installer - MySQL Server Configuration: User
   accounts
   MySQL Installer - MySQL Server Configuration: User accounts
   Note

   If the MySQL Server is already installed, then the Current Root
   Password will also be needed.

   Next, configure the Windows Service Details. This includes the
   service name, how the MySQL Server should be loaded at startup,
   and how the Windows Service for MySQL Server will be run.

   Figure 2.17. MySQL Installer - MySQL Server Configuration: Windows
   service details
   MySQL Installer - MySQL Server Configuration: Windows service
   details
   Note

   When configuring Run Windows Services as ... using a Custom User,
   the custom user must have privileges to log on to Windows as a
   service. And the Next button will be disabled until this user is
   given these user rights.

   On Microsoft Windows 7, this is configured by loading the Start
   Menu, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Local Security Policy,
   Local Policies, User Rights Assignment, then Log On As A Service.
   Choose Add User or Group here to add the custom user, and then OK,
   OK to save.

   The final configuration step is available if the Advanced
   Configuration option was checked, and it includes configuration
   options related to log file names:

   Figure 2.18. MySQL Installer - MySQL Server Configuration: Logging
   options
   MySQL Installer - MySQL Server Configuration: Logging options

   After the MySQL Installer configuration process is completed, you
   may save the installation log, and then load MySQL Workbench if
   the Start MySQL Workbench after Setup option is checked:

   Figure 2.19. MySQL Installer - Installation Complete
   MySQL Installer - Installation Complete

   You can now open MySQL Installer from the Microsoft Windows Start
   menu under the MySQL group, which will load the MySQL Installer
   Maintenance Screen. This is used to add, update, and remove
   features.

   Figure 2.20. MySQL Installer - Maintenance Screen
   MySQL Installer - Maintenance Screen
   Note

   An Update Screen screen is shown if MySQL Installer is used on a
   machine with older products installed, as opposed to the
   Maintenance Screen shown above. However, the functionality remains
   the same.

   Add/Modify Products and Features will list all installed and
   available MySQL products.

   Figure 2.21. MySQL Installer - Add/Modify Products and Features
   MySQL Installer - Add/Modify Products and Features

   The installation is now complete. MySQL Server should be running,
   and most MySQL products installed and available for use.

   See also the MySQL Workbench documentation
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/).

2.3.3.2. MySQL Installer Console

   MySQLInstallerConsole provides functionality similar to the GUI
   version of MySQL Installer, but from the command-line. It is
   installed when MySQL Installer is initially executed, and then
   available within the MySQL Installer directory. Typically that is
   in C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Installer\, and the console
   must be executed with administrative privileges.

   To use, invoke the Command Prompt with administrative privileges
   by choosing Start, Accessories, then right-click on Command Prompt
   and choose Run as administrator. And from the command-line,
   optionally change the directory to where MySQLInstallerConsole is
   located:
C:\> cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Installer"

   MySQLInstallerConsole supports the following options, which are
   specified on the command line:

     * --help, -h, or -?
       Displays a help message with usage examples, and then exits.
C:\> MySQLInstallerConsole --help

     * --updates (or -u)
       Checks for new products before any further action is taken.
       Disabled by default.

     * --nowait

2.3.4. MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows

   The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows is a tool that allows you
   to monitor and adjust the status of your local and remote MySQL
   Server instances through an indicator that resides in the system
   tray. The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows also gives quick
   access to several MySQL GUI tools (such as MySQL Workbench)
   through its context menu.

   The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows is installed by MySQL
   Installer, and (by default) will start-up when Microsoft Windows
   is started.
   Note

   To install, download and execute the MySQL Installer
   (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/), be sure the MySQL
   Notifier for Microsoft Windows product is selected, then proceed
   with the installation. See the MySQL Installer manual for
   additional details.

   For release notes detailing the changes in each release of MySQL
   Notifier for Microsoft Windows, see the MySQL Notifier Release
   Notes (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql-notifier/en/).

   Visit the MySQL Notifier forum
   (http://forums.mysql.com/list.php?173) for additional MySQL
   Notifier for Microsoft Windows help and support.

   Features include:

     * Start, Stop, and Restart instances of the MySQL Server.

     * Automatically detects (and adds) new MySQL Server services.
       These are listed under Manage Monitored Items, and may also be
       configured.

     * The Tray icon changes, depending on the status. It's green if
       all monitored MySQL Server instances are running, or red if at
       least one service is stopped. The Update MySQL Notifier tray
       icon based on service status option, which dictates this
       behavior, is enabled by default for each service.

     * Links to other applications like MySQL Workbench, MySQL
       Installer, and the MySQL Utilities. For example, choosing
       Configure Instance will load the MySQL Workbench Server
       Administration window for that particular instance.

     * If MySQL Workbench is also installed, then the Configure
       Instance and SQL Editor options are available for local (but
       not remote) MySQL instances.

     * Monitoring of both local and remote MySQL instances.

   Note

   Remote monitoring is available since MySQL Notifier for Microsoft
   Windows 1.1.0.

   The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows resides in the system
   tray and provides visual status information for your MySQL Server
   instances. A green icon is displayed at the top left corner of the
   tray icon if the current MySQL Server is running, or a red icon if
   the service is stopped.

   The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows automatically adds
   discovered MySQL Services on the local machine, and each service
   is saved and configurable. By default, the Automatically add new
   services whose name contains option is enabled and set to mysql.
   Related Notifications Options include being notified when new
   services are either discovered or experience status changes, and
   are also enabled by default. And uninstalling a service will also
   remove the service from the MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows.
   Note

   The Automatically add new services whose name contains option
   default changed from ".*mysqld.*" to "mysql" in Notifier 1.1.0.

   Clicking the system tray icon will reveal several options, as seen
   in the screenshots below:

   The Service Instance menu is the main MySQL Notifier for Microsoft
   Windows window, and allows you to Stop, Start, and Restart the
   MySQL Server.

   The Actions menu includes several links to external applications
   (if they are installed), and a a Refresh Status option to manually
   refresh the status of all monitored services (in both local and
   remote computers) and MySQL instances.
   Note

   The main menu will not show the Actions menu when there are no
   services being monitored by MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows.
   Note

   The Refresh Status feature is available since MySQL Notifier for
   Microsoft Windows 1.1.0.

2.3.4.1. Remote monitoring set up and installation instructions

   The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows uses Windows Management
   Instrumentation (WMI) to manage and monitor services in remote
   computers running Windows XP or later. This guide explains how it
   works, and how to set up your system to monitor remote MySQL
   instances.
   Note

   Remote monitoring is available since MySQL Notifier for Microsoft
   Windows 1.1.0.

   In order to configure WMI, it is important to understand that the
   underlying Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) architecture
   is doing the WMI work. Specifically, MySQL Notifier for Microsoft
   Windows is using asynchronous notification queries on remote
   Microsoft Windows hosts as .NET events. These events send an
   asynchronous callback to the computer running the MySQL Notifier
   for Microsoft Windows so it knows when a service status has
   changed on the remote computer. Asynchronous notifications offer
   the best performance compared to semi-synchronous notifications or
   synchronous notifications that use timers.

   Asynchronous notifications requires the remote computer to send a
   callback to the client computer (thus opening a reverse
   connection), so the Windows Firewall and DCOM settings must be
   properly configured for the communication to function properly.

   Figure 2.29. MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows Distributed
   Component Object Model (DCOM)
   MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows Distributed Component Object
   Model (DCOM)

   Most of the common errors thrown by asynchronous WMI notifications
   are related to Windows Firewall blocking the communication, or to
   DCOM / WMI settings not being set up properly. For a list of
   common errors with solutions, see Section 2.3.4.1, "."

   The following steps are required to make WMI function. These steps
   are divided between two machines. A single host computer that runs
   MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows (Computer A), and multiple
   remote machines that are being monitored (Computer B).

2.3.5. Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a noinstall Zip
Archive

   Users who are installing from the noinstall package can use the
   instructions in this section to manually install MySQL. The
   process for installing MySQL from a Zip archive is as follows:

    1. Extract the archive to the desired install directory

    2. Create an option file

    3. Choose a MySQL server type

    4. Start the MySQL server

    5. Secure the default user accounts

   This process is described in the sections that follow.

2.3.5.1. Extracting the Install Archive

   To install MySQL manually, do the following:

    1. If you are upgrading from a previous version please refer to
       Section 2.3.7, "Upgrading MySQL on Windows," before beginning
       the upgrade process.

    2. Make sure that you are logged in as a user with administrator
       privileges.

    3. Choose an installation location. Traditionally, the MySQL
       server is installed in C:\mysql. The MySQL Installer installs
       MySQL under C:\Program Files\MySQL. If you do not install
       MySQL at C:\mysql, you must specify the path to the install
       directory during startup or in an option file. See Section
       2.3.5.2, "Creating an Option File."

    4. Extract the install archive to the chosen installation
       location using your preferred Zip archive tool. Some tools may
       extract the archive to a folder within your chosen
       installation location. If this occurs, you can move the
       contents of the subfolder into the chosen installation
       location.

2.3.5.2. Creating an Option File

   If you need to specify startup options when you run the server,
   you can indicate them on the command line or place them in an
   option file. For options that are used every time the server
   starts, you may find it most convenient to use an option file to
   specify your MySQL configuration. This is particularly true under
   the following circumstances:

     * The installation or data directory locations are different
       from the default locations (C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL
       Server 5.6 and C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\data).

     * You need to tune the server settings, such as memory, cache,
       or InnoDB configuration information.

   When the MySQL server starts on Windows, it looks for option files
   in several locations, such as the Windows directory, C:\, and the
   MySQL installation directory (for the full list of locations, see
   Section 4.2.3.3, "Using Option Files"). The Windows directory
   typically is named something like C:\WINDOWS. You can determine
   its exact location from the value of the WINDIR environment
   variable using the following command:
C:\> echo %WINDIR%

   MySQL looks for options in each location first in the my.ini file,
   and then in the my.cnf file. However, to avoid confusion, it is
   best if you use only one file. If your PC uses a boot loader where
   C: is not the boot drive, your only option is to use the my.ini
   file. Whichever option file you use, it must be a plain text file.
   Note

   When using the MySQL Installer to install MySQL Server, it will
   create the my.ini at the default location. And as of MySQL Server
   5.5.27, the user running MySQL Installer is granted full
   permissions to this new my.ini.

   In other words, be sure that the MySQL Server user has permission
   to read the my.ini file.

   You can also make use of the example option files included with
   your MySQL distribution; see Section 5.1.2, "Server Configuration
   Defaults."

   An option file can be created and modified with any text editor,
   such as Notepad. For example, if MySQL is installed in E:\mysql
   and the data directory is in E:\mydata\data, you can create an
   option file containing a [mysqld] section to specify values for
   the basedir and datadir options:
[mysqld]
# set basedir to your installation path
basedir=E:/mysql
# set datadir to the location of your data directory
datadir=E:/mydata/data

   Note that Windows path names are specified in option files using
   (forward) slashes rather than backslashes. If you do use
   backslashes, double them:
[mysqld]
# set basedir to your installation path
basedir=E:\\mysql
# set datadir to the location of your data directory
datadir=E:\\mydata\\data

   The rules for use of backslash in option file values are given in
   Section 4.2.3.3, "Using Option Files."

   The data directory is located within the AppData directory for the
   user running MySQL.

   If you would like to use a data directory in a different location,
   you should copy the entire contents of the data directory to the
   new location. For example, if you want to use E:\mydata as the
   data directory instead, you must do two things:

    1. Move the entire data directory and all of its contents from
       the default location (for example C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL
       Server 5.6\data) to E:\mydata.

    2. Use a --datadir option to specify the new data directory
       location each time you start the server.

2.3.5.3. Selecting a MySQL Server Type

   The following table shows the available servers for Windows in
   MySQL 5.6.
   Binary Description
   mysqld Optimized binary with named-pipe support
   mysqld-debug Like mysqld, but compiled with full debugging and
   automatic memory allocation checking

   All of the preceding binaries are optimized for modern Intel
   processors, but should work on any Intel i386-class or higher
   processor.

   Each of the servers in a distribution support the same set of
   storage engines. The SHOW ENGINES statement displays which engines
   a given server supports.

   All Windows MySQL 5.6 servers have support for symbolic linking of
   database directories.

   MySQL supports TCP/IP on all Windows platforms. MySQL servers on
   Windows support named pipes as indicated in the following list.
   However, the default is to use TCP/IP regardless of platform.
   (Named pipes are slower than TCP/IP in many Windows
   configurations.)

   Named pipes are enabled only if you start the server with the
   --enable-named-pipe option. It is necessary to use this option
   explicitly because some users have experienced problems with
   shutting down the MySQL server when named pipes were used.

2.3.5.4. Starting the Server for the First Time

   This section gives a general overview of starting the MySQL
   server. The following sections provide more specific information
   for starting the MySQL server from the command line or as a
   Windows service.

   The information here applies primarily if you installed MySQL
   using the Noinstall version, or if you wish to configure and test
   MySQL manually rather than with the GUI tools.
   Note

   The MySQL server will automatically start after using the MySQL
   Installer, and the MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows GUI can be
   used to start/stop/restart at any time.

   The examples in these sections assume that MySQL is installed
   under the default location of C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
   5.6. Adjust the path names shown in the examples if you have MySQL
   installed in a different location.

   Clients have two options. They can use TCP/IP, or they can use a
   named pipe if the server supports named-pipe connections.

   MySQL for Windows also supports shared-memory connections if the
   server is started with the --shared-memory option. Clients can
   connect through shared memory by using the --protocol=MEMORY
   option.

   For information about which server binary to run, see Section
   2.3.5.3, "Selecting a MySQL Server Type."

   Testing is best done from a command prompt in a console window (or
   "DOS window"). In this way you can have the server display status
   messages in the window where they are easy to see. If something is
   wrong with your configuration, these messages make it easier for
   you to identify and fix any problems.

   To start the server, enter this command:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqld" --console

   For a server that includes InnoDB support, you should see the
   messages similar to those following as it starts (the path names
   and sizes may differ):
InnoDB: The first specified datafile c:\ibdata\ibdata1 did not exist:
InnoDB: a new database to be created!
InnoDB: Setting file c:\ibdata\ibdata1 size to 209715200
InnoDB: Database physically writes the file full: wait...
InnoDB: Log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile0 did not exist: new to be creat
ed
InnoDB: Setting log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile0 size to 31457280
InnoDB: Log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile1 did not exist: new to be creat
ed
InnoDB: Setting log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile1 size to 31457280
InnoDB: Log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile2 did not exist: new to be creat
ed
InnoDB: Setting log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile2 size to 31457280
InnoDB: Doublewrite buffer not found: creating new
InnoDB: Doublewrite buffer created
InnoDB: creating foreign key constraint system tables
InnoDB: foreign key constraint system tables created
011024 10:58:25  InnoDB: Started

   When the server finishes its startup sequence, you should see
   something like this, which indicates that the server is ready to
   service client connections:
mysqld: ready for connections
Version: '5.6.14'  socket: ''  port: 3306

   The server continues to write to the console any further
   diagnostic output it produces. You can open a new console window
   in which to run client programs.

   If you omit the --console option, the server writes diagnostic
   output to the error log in the data directory (C:\Program
   Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\data by default). The error log is
   the file with the .err extension, and may be set using the
   --log-error option.
   Note

   The accounts that are listed in the MySQL grant tables initially
   have no passwords. After starting the server, you should set up
   passwords for them using the instructions in Section 2.10,
   "Postinstallation Setup and Testing."

2.3.5.5. Starting MySQL from the Windows Command Line

   The MySQL server can be started manually from the command line.
   This can be done on any version of Windows.
   Note

   The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows GUI can also be used to
   start/stop/restart the MySQL server.

   To start the mysqld server from the command line, you should start
   a console window (or "DOS window") and enter this command:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqld"

   The path to mysqld may vary depending on the install location of
   MySQL on your system.

   You can stop the MySQL server by executing this command:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqladmin" -u root
 shutdown

   Note

   If the MySQL root user account has a password, you need to invoke
   mysqladmin with the -p option and supply the password when
   prompted.

   This command invokes the MySQL administrative utility mysqladmin
   to connect to the server and tell it to shut down. The command
   connects as the MySQL root user, which is the default
   administrative account in the MySQL grant system. Note that users
   in the MySQL grant system are wholly independent from any login
   users under Windows.

   If mysqld doesn't start, check the error log to see whether the
   server wrote any messages there to indicate the cause of the
   problem. By default, the error log is located in the C:\Program
   Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\data directory. It is the file with a
   suffix of .err, or may be specified by passing in the --log-error
   option. Alternatively, you can try to start the server as mysqld
   --console; in this case, you may get some useful information on
   the screen that may help solve the problem.

   The last option is to start mysqld with the --standalone and
   --debug options. In this case, mysqld writes a log file
   C:\mysqld.trace that should contain the reason why mysqld doesn't
   start. See MySQL Internals: Porting to Other Systems
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/porting.html).

   Use mysqld --verbose --help to display all the options that mysqld
   supports.

2.3.5.6. Customizing the PATH for MySQL Tools

   To make it easier to invoke MySQL programs, you can add the path
   name of the MySQL bin directory to your Windows system PATH
   environment variable:

     * On the Windows desktop, right-click the My Computer icon, and
       select Properties.

     * Next select the Advanced tab from the System Properties menu
       that appears, and click the Environment Variables button.

     * Under System Variables, select Path, and then click the Edit
       button. The Edit System Variable dialogue should appear.

     * Place your cursor at the end of the text appearing in the
       space marked Variable Value. (Use the End key to ensure that
       your cursor is positioned at the very end of the text in this
       space.) Then enter the complete path name of your MySQL bin
       directory (for example, C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
       5.6\bin)
       Note
       There must be a semicolon separating this path from any values
       present in this field.
       Dismiss this dialogue, and each dialogue in turn, by clicking
       OK until all of the dialogues that were opened have been
       dismissed. You should now be able to invoke any MySQL
       executable program by typing its name at the DOS prompt from
       any directory on the system, without having to supply the
       path. This includes the servers, the mysql client, and all
       MySQL command-line utilities such as mysqladmin and mysqldump.
       You should not add the MySQL bin directory to your Windows
       PATH if you are running multiple MySQL servers on the same
       machine.

   Warning

   You must exercise great care when editing your system PATH by
   hand; accidental deletion or modification of any portion of the
   existing PATH value can leave you with a malfunctioning or even
   unusable system.

2.3.5.7. Starting MySQL as a Windows Service

   On Windows, the recommended way to run MySQL is to install it as a
   Windows service, so that MySQL starts and stops automatically when
   Windows starts and stops. A MySQL server installed as a service
   can also be controlled from the command line using NET commands,
   or with the graphical Services utility. Generally, to install
   MySQL as a Windows service you should be logged in using an
   account that has administrator rights.
   Note

   The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows GUI can also be used to
   monitor the status of the MySQL service.

   The Services utility (the Windows Service Control Manager) can be
   found in the Windows Control Panel (under Administrative Tools on
   Windows 2000, XP, Vista, and Server 2003). To avoid conflicts, it
   is advisable to close the Services utility while performing server
   installation or removal operations from the command line.

   Before installing MySQL as a Windows service, you should first
   stop the current server if it is running by using the following
   command:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqladmin"
          -u root shutdown

   Note

   If the MySQL root user account has a password, you need to invoke
   mysqladmin with the -p option and supply the password when
   prompted.

   This command invokes the MySQL administrative utility mysqladmin
   to connect to the server and tell it to shut down. The command
   connects as the MySQL root user, which is the default
   administrative account in the MySQL grant system. Note that users
   in the MySQL grant system are wholly independent from any login
   users under Windows.

   Install the server as a service using this command:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqld" --install

   The service-installation command does not start the server.
   Instructions for that are given later in this section.

   To make it easier to invoke MySQL programs, you can add the path
   name of the MySQL bin directory to your Windows system PATH
   environment variable:

     * On the Windows desktop, right-click the My Computer icon, and
       select Properties.

     * Next select the Advanced tab from the System Properties menu
       that appears, and click the Environment Variables button.

     * Under System Variables, select Path, and then click the Edit
       button. The Edit System Variable dialogue should appear.

     * Place your cursor at the end of the text appearing in the
       space marked Variable Value. (Use the End key to ensure that
       your cursor is positioned at the very end of the text in this
       space.) Then enter the complete path name of your MySQL bin
       directory (for example, C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
       5.6\bin), Note that there should be a semicolon separating
       this path from any values present in this field. Dismiss this
       dialogue, and each dialogue in turn, by clicking OK until all
       of the dialogues that were opened have been dismissed. You
       should now be able to invoke any MySQL executable program by
       typing its name at the DOS prompt from any directory on the
       system, without having to supply the path. This includes the
       servers, the mysql client, and all MySQL command-line
       utilities such as mysqladmin and mysqldump.
       You should not add the MySQL bin directory to your Windows
       PATH if you are running multiple MySQL servers on the same
       machine.

   Warning

   You must exercise great care when editing your system PATH by
   hand; accidental deletion or modification of any portion of the
   existing PATH value can leave you with a malfunctioning or even
   unusable system.

   The following additional arguments can be used when installing the
   service:

     * You can specify a service name immediately following the
       --install option. The default service name is MySQL.

     * If a service name is given, it can be followed by a single
       option. By convention, this should be
       --defaults-file=file_name to specify the name of an option
       file from which the server should read options when it starts.
       The use of a single option other than --defaults-file is
       possible but discouraged. --defaults-file is more flexible
       because it enables you to specify multiple startup options for
       the server by placing them in the named option file.

     * You can also specify a --local-service option following the
       service name. This causes the server to run using the
       LocalService Windows account that has limited system
       privileges. This account is available only for Windows XP or
       newer. If both --defaults-file and --local-service are given
       following the service name, they can be in any order.

   For a MySQL server that is installed as a Windows service, the
   following rules determine the service name and option files that
   the server uses:

     * If the service-installation command specifies no service name
       or the default service name (MySQL) following the --install
       option, the server uses the a service name of MySQL and reads
       options from the [mysqld] group in the standard option files.

     * If the service-installation command specifies a service name
       other than MySQL following the --install option, the server
       uses that service name. It reads options from the [mysqld]
       group and the group that has the same name as the service in
       the standard option files. This enables you to use the
       [mysqld] group for options that should be used by all MySQL
       services, and an option group with the service name for use by
       the server installed with that service name.

     * If the service-installation command specifies a
       --defaults-file option after the service name, the server
       reads options the same way as described in the previous item,
       except that it reads options only from the the named file and
       ignores the standard option files.

   As a more complex example, consider the following command:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqld"
          --install MySQL --defaults-file=C:\my-opts.cnf

   Here, the default service name (MySQL) is given after the
   --install option. If no --defaults-file option had been given,
   this command would have the effect of causing the server to read
   the [mysqld] group from the standard option files. However,
   because the --defaults-file option is present, the server reads
   options from the [mysqld] option group, and only from the named
   file.

   You can also specify options as Start parameters in the Windows
   Services utility before you start the MySQL service.

   Once a MySQL server has been installed as a service, Windows
   starts the service automatically whenever Windows starts. The
   service also can be started immediately from the Services utility,
   or by using a NET START MySQL command. The NET command is not case
   sensitive.

   When run as a service, mysqld has no access to a console window,
   so no messages can be seen there. If mysqld does not start, check
   the error log to see whether the server wrote any messages there
   to indicate the cause of the problem. The error log is located in
   the MySQL data directory (for example, C:\Program
   Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\data). It is the file with a suffix
   of .err.

   When a MySQL server has been installed as a service, and the
   service is running, Windows stops the service automatically when
   Windows shuts down. The server also can be stopped manually by
   using the Services utility, the NET STOP MySQL command, or the
   mysqladmin shutdown command.

   You also have the choice of installing the server as a manual
   service if you do not wish for the service to be started
   automatically during the boot process. To do this, use the
   --install-manual option rather than the --install option:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqld" --install-m
anual

   To remove a server that is installed as a service, first stop it
   if it is running by executing NET STOP MySQL. Then use the
   --remove option to remove it:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqld" --remove

   If mysqld is not running as a service, you can start it from the
   command line. For instructions, see Section 2.3.5.5, "Starting
   MySQL from the Windows Command Line."

   If you encounter difficulties during installation. see Section
   2.3.6, "Troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows MySQL Server
   Installation."

2.3.5.8. Testing The MySQL Installation

   You can test whether the MySQL server is working by executing any
   of the following commands:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqlshow"
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqlshow" -u root
mysql
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqladmin" version
 status proc
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysql" test

   If mysqld is slow to respond to TCP/IP connections from client
   programs, there is probably a problem with your DNS. In this case,
   start mysqld with the --skip-name-resolve option and use only
   localhost and IP addresses in the Host column of the MySQL grant
   tables.

   You can force a MySQL client to use a named-pipe connection rather
   than TCP/IP by specifying the --pipe or --protocol=PIPE option, or
   by specifying . (period) as the host name. Use the --socket option
   to specify the name of the pipe if you do not want to use the
   default pipe name.

   Note that if you have set a password for the root account, deleted
   the anonymous account, or created a new user account, then you
   must use the appropriate -u and -p options with the commands shown
   above to connect with the MySQL Server. See Section 4.2.2,
   "Connecting to the MySQL Server."

   For more information about mysqlshow, see Section 4.5.6,
   "mysqlshow --- Display Database, Table, and Column Information."

2.3.6. Troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows MySQL Server Installation

   When installing and running MySQL for the first time, you may
   encounter certain errors that prevent the MySQL server from
   starting. This section helps you diagnose and correct some of
   these errors.

   Your first resource when troubleshooting server issues is the
   error log. The MySQL server uses the error log to record
   information relevant to the error that prevents the server from
   starting. The error log is located in the data directory specified
   in your my.ini file. The default data directory location is
   C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\data, or
   C:\ProgramData\Mysql on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008. The
   C:\ProgramData directory is hidden by default. You need to change
   your folder options to see the directory and contents. For more
   information on the error log and understanding the content, see
   Section 5.2.2, "The Error Log."

   For information regarding possible errors, also consult the
   console messages displayed when the MySQL service is starting. Use
   the NET START MySQL command from the command line after installing
   mysqld as a service to see any error messages regarding the
   starting of the MySQL server as a service. See Section 2.3.5.7,
   "Starting MySQL as a Windows Service."

   The following examples show other common error messages you might
   encounter when installing MySQL and starting the server for the
   first time:

     * If the MySQL server cannot find the mysql privileges database
       or other critical files, it displays these messages:
System error 1067 has occurred.
Fatal error: Can't open and lock privilege tables:
Table 'mysql.user' doesn't exist
       These messages often occur when the MySQL base or data
       directories are installed in different locations than the
       default locations (C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6 and
       C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\data, respectively).
       This situation can occur when MySQL is upgraded and installed
       to a new location, but the configuration file is not updated
       to reflect the new location. In addition, old and new
       configuration files might conflict. Be sure to delete or
       rename any old configuration files when upgrading MySQL.
       If you have installed MySQL to a directory other than
       C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6, ensure that the MySQL
       server is aware of this through the use of a configuration
       (my.ini) file. Put the my.ini file in your Windows directory,
       typically C:\WINDOWS. To determine its exact location from the
       value of the WINDIR environment variable, issue the following
       command from the command prompt:
C:\> echo %WINDIR%
       You can create or modify an option file with any text editor,
       such as Notepad. For example, if MySQL is installed in
       E:\mysql and the data directory is D:\MySQLdata, you can
       create the option file and set up a [mysqld] section to
       specify values for the basedir and datadir options:
[mysqld]
# set basedir to your installation path
basedir=E:/mysql
# set datadir to the location of your data directory
datadir=D:/MySQLdata
       Note that Windows path names are specified in option files
       using (forward) slashes rather than backslashes. If you do use
       backslashes, double them:
[mysqld]
# set basedir to your installation path
basedir=C:\\Program Files\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 5.6
# set datadir to the location of your data directory
datadir=D:\\MySQLdata
       The rules for use of backslash in option file values are given
       in Section 4.2.3.3, "Using Option Files."
       If you change the datadir value in your MySQL configuration
       file, you must move the contents of the existing MySQL data
       directory before restarting the MySQL server.
       See Section 2.3.5.2, "Creating an Option File."

     * If you reinstall or upgrade MySQL without first stopping and
       removing the existing MySQL service and install MySQL using
       the MySQL Installer, you might see this error:
Error: Cannot create Windows service for MySql. Error: 0
       This occurs when the Configuration Wizard tries to install the
       service and finds an existing service with the same name.
       One solution to this problem is to choose a service name other
       than mysql when using the configuration wizard. This enables
       the new service to be installed correctly, but leaves the
       outdated service in place. Although this is harmless, it is
       best to remove old services that are no longer in use.
       To permanently remove the old mysql service, execute the
       following command as a user with administrative privileges, on
       the command line:
C:\> sc delete mysql
[SC] DeleteService SUCCESS
       If the sc utility is not available for your version of
       Windows, download the delsrv utility from
       http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/reskit/tools/exi
       sting/delsrv-o.asp and use the delsrv mysql syntax.

2.3.7. Upgrading MySQL on Windows

   This section lists some of the steps to take when upgrading MySQL
   on Windows.

    1. Review Section 2.11.1, "Upgrading MySQL," for additional
       information on upgrading MySQL that is not specific to
       Windows.

    2. Always back up your current MySQL installation before
       performing an upgrade. See Section 7.2, "Database Backup
       Methods."

    3. Download the latest Windows distribution of MySQL from
       http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/.

    4. Before upgrading MySQL, stop the server. If the server is
       installed as a service, stop the service with the following
       command from the command prompt:
C:\> NET STOP MySQL
       If you are not running the MySQL server as a service, use
       mysqladmin to stop it. For example, before upgrading from
       MySQL 5.5 to 5.6, use mysqladmin from MySQL 5.5 as follows:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\bin\mysqladmin" -u root
 shutdown
       Note
       If the MySQL root user account has a password, invoke
       mysqladmin with the -p option and supply the password when
       prompted.

    5. Before upgrading to MySQL 5.6 from a version previous to
       4.1.5, or from a version of MySQL installed from a Zip archive
       to a version of MySQL installed with the MySQL Installation
       Wizard, you must first manually remove the previous
       installation and MySQL service (if the server is installed as
       a service).
       To remove the MySQL service, use the following command:
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --remove
       If you do not remove the existing service, the MySQL
       Installation Wizard may fail to properly install the new MySQL
       service.

    6. If you are using the MySQL Installer, start it as described in
       Section 2.3.3, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using
       MySQL Installer."

    7. If you are installing MySQL from a Zip archive, extract the
       archive. You may either overwrite your existing MySQL
       installation (usually located at C:\mysql), or install it into
       a different directory, such as C:\mysql5. Overwriting the
       existing installation is recommended.

    8. If you were running MySQL as a Windows service and you had to
       remove the service earlier in this procedure, reinstall the
       service. (See Section 2.3.5.7, "Starting MySQL as a Windows
       Service.")

    9. Restart the server. For example, use NET START MySQL if you
       run MySQL as a service, or invoke mysqld directly otherwise.
   10. As Administrator, run mysql_upgrade to check your tables,
       attempt to repair them if necessary, and update your grant
       tables if they have changed so that you can take advantage of
       any new capabilities. See Section 4.4.7, "mysql_upgrade ---
       Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables."
   11. If you encounter errors, see Section 2.3.6, "Troubleshooting a
       Microsoft Windows MySQL Server Installation."

2.3.8. Windows Postinstallation Procedures

   GUI tools exist that perform most of the tasks described below,
   including:

     * MySQL Installer: Used to install and upgrade MySQL products.

     * MySQL Workbench: Manages the MySQL server and edits SQL
       queries.

     * MySQL Notifier: Starts, stops, or restarts the MySQL server,
       and monitors its status.

     * MySQL for Excel: Edits MySQL data with Microsoft Excel.

   On Windows, you need not create the data directory and the grant
   tables. MySQL Windows distributions include the grant tables with
   a set of preinitialized accounts in the mysql database under the
   data directory. Regarding passwords, if you installed MySQL using
   the MySQL Installer, you may have already assigned passwords to
   the accounts. (See Section 2.3.3, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft
   Windows Using MySQL Installer.") Otherwise, use the
   password-assignment procedure given in Section 2.10.2, "Securing
   the Initial MySQL Accounts."

   Before setting up passwords, you might want to try running some
   client programs to make sure that you can connect to the server
   and that it is operating properly. Make sure that the server is
   running (see Section 2.3.5.4, "Starting the Server for the First
   Time"), and then issue the following commands to verify that you
   can retrieve information from the server. You may need to specify
   directory different from C:\mysql\bin on the command line. If you
   used the MySQL Installer, the default directory is C:\Program
   Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6, and the mysql and mysqlshow client
   programs are in C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin. See
   Section 2.3.3, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using MySQL
   Installer," for more information.

   Use mysqlshow to see what databases exist:
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow
+--------------------+
|     Databases      |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| test               |
+--------------------+

   The list of installed databases may vary, but will always include
   the minimum of mysql and information_schema. In most cases, the
   test database will also be installed automatically.

   The preceding command (and commands for other MySQL programs such
   as mysql) may not work if the correct MySQL account does not
   exist. For example, the program may fail with an error, or you may
   not be able to view all databases. If you installed using MySQL
   Installer, then the root user will have been created automatically
   with the password you supplied. In this case, you should use the
   -u root and -p options. (You will also need to use the -u root and
   -p options if you have already secured the initial MySQL
   accounts.) With -p, you will be prompted for the root password.
   For example:
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow -u root -p
Enter password: (enter root password here)
+--------------------+
|     Databases      |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| test               |
+--------------------+

   If you specify a database name, mysqlshow displays a list of the
   tables within the database:
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow mysql
Database: mysql
+---------------------------+
|          Tables           |
+---------------------------+
| columns_priv              |
| db                        |
| event                     |
| func                      |
| help_category             |
| help_keyword              |
| help_relation             |
| help_topic                |
| host                      |
| plugin                    |
| proc                      |
| procs_priv                |
| servers                   |
| tables_priv               |
| time_zone                 |
| time_zone_leap_second     |
| time_zone_name            |
| time_zone_transition      |
| time_zone_transition_type |
| user                      |
+---------------------------+

   Use the mysql program to select information from a table in the
   mysql database:
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysql -e "SELECT Host,Db,User FROM mysql.db"
+------+--------+------+
| host | db     | user |
+------+--------+------+
| %    | test   |      |
| %    | test_% |      |
+------+--------+------+

   For more information about mysqlshow and mysql, see Section 4.5.6,
   "mysqlshow --- Display Database, Table, and Column Information,"
   and Section 4.5.1, "mysql --- The MySQL Command-Line Tool."

   If you are running a version of Windows that supports services,
   you can set up the MySQL server to run automatically when Windows
   starts. See Section 2.3.5.7, "Starting MySQL as a Windows
   Service."
