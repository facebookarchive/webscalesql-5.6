Chapter 2 Installing and Upgrading MySQL

   This chapter describes how to obtain and install MySQL. A summary
   of the procedure follows and later sections provide the details.
   If you plan to upgrade an existing version of MySQL to a newer
   version rather than install MySQL for the first time, see Section
   2.10.1, "Upgrading MySQL," for information about upgrade
   procedures and about issues that you should consider before
   upgrading.

   If you are interested in migrating to MySQL from another database
   system, you may wish to read Section B.8, "MySQL 5.6 FAQ:
   Migration," which contains answers to some common questions
   concerning migration issues.

   Installation of MySQL generally follows the steps outlined here:

    1. Determine whether MySQL runs and is supported on your
       platform.
       Please note that not all platforms are equally suitable for
       running MySQL, and that not all platforms on which MySQL is
       known to run are officially supported by Oracle Corporation:

    2. Choose which distribution to install.
       Several versions of MySQL are available, and most are
       available in several distribution formats. You can choose from
       pre-packaged distributions containing binary (precompiled)
       programs or source code. When in doubt, use a binary
       distribution. We also provide public access to our current
       source tree for those who want to see our most recent
       developments and help us test new code. To determine which
       version and type of distribution you should use, see Section
       2.1.2, "Choosing Which MySQL Distribution to Install."

    3. Download the distribution that you want to install.
       For instructions, see Section 2.1.3, "How to Get MySQL." To
       verify the integrity of the distribution, use the instructions
       in Section 2.1.4, "Verifying Package Integrity Using MD5
       Checksums or GnuPG."

    4. Install the distribution.
       To install MySQL from a binary distribution, use the
       instructions in Section 2.2, "Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux
       Using Generic Binaries."
       To install MySQL from a source distribution or from the
       current development source tree, use the instructions in
       Section 2.8, "Installing MySQL from Source."

    5. Perform any necessary postinstallation setup.
       After installing MySQL, see Section 2.9, "Postinstallation
       Setup and Testing" for information about making sure the MySQL
       server is working properly. Also refer to the information
       provided in Section 2.9.2, "Securing the Initial MySQL
       Accounts." This section describes how to secure the initial
       MySQL user accounts, which have no passwords until you assign
       passwords. The section applies whether you install MySQL using
       a binary or source distribution.

    6. If you want to run the MySQL benchmark scripts, Perl support
       for MySQL must be available. See Section 2.12, "Perl
       Installation Notes."

   Instructions for installing MySQL on different platforms and
   environments is available on a platform by platform basis:

     * Unix, Linux, FreeBSD
       For instructions on installing MySQL on most Linux and Unix
       platforms using a generic binary (for example, a .tar.gz
       package), see Section 2.2, "Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux
       Using Generic Binaries."
       For information on building MySQL entirely from the source
       code distributions or the source code repositories, see
       Section 2.8, "Installing MySQL from Source"
       For specific platform help on installation, configuration, and
       building from source see the corresponding platform section:

          + Linux, including notes on distribution specific methods,
            see Section 2.5, "Installing MySQL on Linux."

          + Solaris and OpenSolaris, including PKG and IPS formats,
            see Section 2.6, "Installing MySQL on Solaris and
            OpenSolaris."

          + IBM AIX, see Section 2.6, "Installing MySQL on Solaris
            and OpenSolaris."

          + FreeBSD, see Section 2.7, "Installing MySQL on FreeBSD."

     * Microsoft Windows
       For instructions on installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows,
       using either a Zipped binary or an MSI package, see Section
       2.3, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows."
       For details and instructions on building MySQL from source
       code using Microsoft Visual Studio, see Section 2.8,
       "Installing MySQL from Source."

     * Mac OS X
       For installation on Mac OS X, including using both the binary
       package and native PKG formats, see Section 2.4, "Installing
       MySQL on Mac OS X."
       For information on making use of the MySQL Startup Item to
       automatically start and stop MySQL, see Section 2.4.3,
       "Installing the MySQL Startup Item."
       For information on the MySQL Preference Pane, see Section
       2.4.4, "Installing and Using the MySQL Preference Pane."

2.1 General Installation Guidance

   The immediately following sections contain the information
   necessary to choose, download, and verify your distribution. The
   instructions in later sections of the chapter describe how to
   install the distribution that you choose. For binary
   distributions, see the instructions at Section 2.2, "Installing
   MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries" or the corresponding
   section for your platform if available. To build MySQL from
   source, use the instructions in Section 2.8, "Installing MySQL
   from Source."

2.1.1 Operating Systems Supported by MySQL Community Server

   MySQL is available on a number of operating systems and platforms.
   For information about those platforms that are officially
   supported, see
   http://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html on
   the MySQL Web site.

2.1.2 Choosing Which MySQL Distribution to Install

   When preparing to install MySQL, you should decide which version
   to use. MySQL development occurs in several release series, and
   you can pick the one that best fits your needs. After deciding
   which version to install, you can choose a distribution format.
   Releases are available in binary or source format.

2.1.2.1 Choosing Which Version of MySQL to Install

   The first decision to make is whether you want to use a production
   (stable) release or a development release. In the MySQL
   development process, multiple release series co-exist, each at a
   different stage of maturity.

Production Releases


     * MySQL 5.6: Latest General Availability (Production) release

     * MySQL 5.5: Previous General Availability (Production) release

     * MySQL 5.1: Older General Availability (Production) release

     * MySQL 5.0: Older Production release nearing the end of the
       product lifecycle

   MySQL 4.1, 4.0, and 3.23 are old releases that are no longer
   supported.

   See http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/lifecycle/ for information
   about support policies and schedules.

   Normally, if you are beginning to use MySQL for the first time or
   trying to port it to some system for which there is no binary
   distribution, use the most recent General Availability series
   listed in the preceding descriptions. All MySQL releases, even
   those from development series, are checked with the MySQL
   benchmarks and an extensive test suite before being issued.

   If you are running an older system and want to upgrade, but do not
   want to take the chance of having a nonseamless upgrade, you
   should upgrade to the latest version in the same release series
   you are using (where only the last part of the version number is
   newer than yours). We have tried to fix only fatal bugs and make
   only small, relatively "safe" changes to that version.

   If you want to use new features not present in the production
   release series, you can use a version from a development series.
   Be aware that development releases are not as stable as production
   releases.

   We do not use a complete code freeze because this prevents us from
   making bugfixes and other fixes that must be done. We may add
   small things that should not affect anything that currently works
   in a production release. Naturally, relevant bugfixes from an
   earlier series propagate to later series.

   If you want to use the very latest sources containing all current
   patches and bugfixes, you can use one of our source code
   repositories (see Section 2.8.3, "Installing MySQL Using a
   Development Source Tree"). These are not "releases" as such, but
   are available as previews of the code on which future releases are
   to be based.

   The naming scheme in MySQL 5.6 uses release names that consist of
   three numbers and a suffix; for example, mysql-5.6.1-m1. The
   numbers within the release name are interpreted as follows:

     * The first number (5) is the major version and describes the
       file format. All MySQL 5 releases have the same file format.

     * The second number (6) is the release level. Taken together,
       the major version and release level constitute the release
       series number.

     * The third number (1) is the version number within the release
       series. This is incremented for each new release. Usually you
       want the latest version for the series you have chosen.

   For each minor update, the last number in the version string is
   incremented. When there are major new features or minor
   incompatibilities with previous versions, the second number in the
   version string is incremented. When the file format changes, the
   first number is increased.

   Release names also include a suffix to indicates the stability
   level of the release. Releases within a series progress through a
   set of suffixes to indicate how the stability level improves. The
   possible suffixes are:

     * mN (for example, m1, m2, m3, ...) indicate a milestone number.
       MySQL development uses a milestone model, in which each
       milestone proceeds through a small number of versions with a
       tight focus on a small subset of thoroughly tested features.
       Following the releases for one milestone, development proceeds
       with another small number of releases that focuses on the next
       small set of features, also thoroughly tested. Features within
       milestone releases may be considered to be of pre-production
       quality.

     * rc indicates a Release Candidate. Release candidates are
       believed to be stable, having passed all of MySQL's internal
       testing, and with all known fatal runtime bugs fixed. However,
       the release has not been in widespread use long enough to know
       for sure that all bugs have been identified. Only minor fixes
       are added.

     * If there is no suffix, it indicates that the release is a
       General Availability (GA) or Production release. GA releases
       are stable, having successfully passed through all earlier
       release stages and are believed to be reliable, free of
       serious bugs, and suitable for use in production systems. Only
       critical bugfixes are applied to the release.

   All releases of MySQL are run through our standard tests and
   benchmarks to ensure that they are relatively safe to use. Because
   the standard tests are extended over time to check for all
   previously found bugs, the test suite keeps getting better.

   All releases have been tested at least with these tools:

     * An internal test suite.  The mysql-test directory contains an
       extensive set of test cases. We run these tests for every
       server binary. See Section 23.1.2, "The MySQL Test Suite," for
       more information about this test suite.

     * The MySQL benchmark suite.  This suite runs a range of common
       queries. It is also a test to determine whether the latest
       batch of optimizations actually made the code faster. See
       Section 8.12.2, "The MySQL Benchmark Suite."

   We also perform additional integration and nonfunctional testing
   of the latest MySQL version in our internal production
   environment. Integration testing is done with different
   connectors, storage engines, replication modes, backup,
   partitioning, stored programs, and so forth in various
   combinations. Additional nonfunctional testing is done in areas of
   performance, concurrency, stress, high volume, upgrade and
   downgrade.

2.1.2.2 Choosing a Distribution Format

   After choosing which version of MySQL to install, you should
   decide whether to use a binary distribution or a source
   distribution. In most cases, you should probably use a binary
   distribution, if one exists for your platform. Binary
   distributions are available in native format for many platforms,
   such as RPM packages for Linux, DMG packages for Mac OS X, and PKG
   packages for Solaris. Distributions are also available in more
   generic formats such as Zip archives or compressed tar files.

   Reasons to choose a binary distribution include the following:

     * Binary distributions generally are easier to install than
       source distributions.

     * To satisfy different user requirements, we provide several
       servers in binary distributions. mysqld is an optimized server
       that is a smaller, faster binary. mysqld-debug is compiled
       with debugging support.
       Each of these servers is compiled from the same source
       distribution, though with different configuration options. All
       native MySQL clients can connect to servers from either MySQL
       version.

   Under some circumstances, you may be better off installing MySQL
   from a source distribution:

     * You want to install MySQL at some explicit location. The
       standard binary distributions are ready to run at any
       installation location, but you might require even more
       flexibility to place MySQL components where you want.

     * You want to configure mysqld to ensure that features are
       available that might not be included in the standard binary
       distributions. Here is a list of the most common extra options
       that you may want to use to ensure feature availability:

          + -DWITH_LIBWRAP=1 for TCP wrappers support.

          + -DWITH_ZLIB={system|bundled} for features that depend on
            compression

          + -DWITH_DEBUG=1 for debugging support
       For additional information, see Section 2.8.4, "MySQL
       Source-Configuration Options."

     * You want to configure mysqld without some features that are
       included in the standard binary distributions. For example,
       distributions normally are compiled with support for all
       character sets. If you want a smaller MySQL server, you can
       recompile it with support for only the character sets you
       need.

     * You want to use the latest sources from one of the Bazaar
       repositories to have access to all current bugfixes. For
       example, if you have found a bug and reported it to the MySQL
       development team, the bugfix is committed to the source
       repository and you can access it there. The bugfix does not
       appear in a release until a release actually is issued.

     * You want to read (or modify) the C and C++ code that makes up
       MySQL. For this purpose, you should get a source distribution,
       because the source code is always the ultimate manual.

     * Source distributions contain more tests and examples than
       binary distributions.

2.1.2.3 How and When Updates Are Released

   MySQL is evolving quite rapidly and we want to share new
   developments with other MySQL users. We try to produce a new
   release whenever we have new and useful features that others also
   seem to have a need for.

   We also try to help users who request features that are easy to
   implement. We take note of what our licensed users want, and we
   especially take note of what our support customers want and try to
   help them in this regard.

   No one is required to download a new release. The Release Notes
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/) help you
   determine whether the new release has something you really want.

   We use the following policy when updating MySQL:

     * Enterprise Server releases are meant to appear every 18
       months, supplemented by quarterly service packs and monthly
       rapid updates. Community Server releases are meant to appear 2
       to 3 times per year.

     * Releases are issued within each series. For each release, the
       last number in the version is one more than the previous
       release within the same series.

     * Binary distributions for some platforms are made by us for
       major releases. Other people may make binary distributions for
       other systems, but probably less frequently.

     * We make fixes available as soon as we have identified and
       corrected small or noncritical but annoying bugs. The fixes
       are available in source form immediately from our public
       Bazaar repositories, and are included in the next release.

     * If by any chance a security vulnerability or critical bug is
       found in a release, our policy is to fix it in a new release
       as soon as possible. (We would like other companies to do
       this, too!)

2.1.3 How to Get MySQL

   Check our downloads page at http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ for
   information about the current version of MySQL and for downloading
   instructions. For a complete up-to-date list of MySQL download
   mirror sites, see http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mirrors.html. You
   can also find information there about becoming a MySQL mirror site
   and how to report a bad or out-of-date mirror.

   For RPM-based Linux platforms that use Yum as their package
   management system, MySQL can be installed using the MySQL Yum
   repository (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/). See Section
   2.5.1, "Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL Yum Repository"
   for details.

   To obtain the latest development source, see Section 2.8.3,
   "Installing MySQL Using a Development Source Tree."

2.1.4 Verifying Package Integrity Using MD5 Checksums or GnuPG

   After you have downloaded the MySQL package that suits your needs
   and before you attempt to install it, you should make sure that it
   is intact and has not been tampered with. There are three means of
   integrity checking:

     * MD5 checksums

     * Cryptographic signatures using GnuPG, the GNU Privacy Guard

     * For RPM packages, the built-in RPM integrity verification
       mechanism

   The following sections describe how to use these methods.

   If you notice that the MD5 checksum or GPG signatures do not
   match, first try to download the respective package one more time,
   perhaps from another mirror site.

2.1.4.1 Verifying the MD5 Checksum

   After you have downloaded a MySQL package, you should make sure
   that its MD5 checksum matches the one provided on the MySQL
   download pages. Each package has an individual checksum that you
   can verify against the package that you downloaded. The correct
   MD5 checksum is listed on the downloads page for each MySQL
   product, and you will compare it against the MD5 checksum of the
   file (product) that you download.

   Each operating system and setup offers its own version of tools
   for checking the MD5 checksum. Typically the command is named
   md5sum, or it may be named md5, and some operating systems do not
   ship it at all. On Linux, it is part of the GNU Text Utilities
   package, which is available for a wide range of platforms. You can
   also download the source code from
   http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/. If you have OpenSSL
   installed, you can use the command openssl md5 package_name
   instead. A Windows implementation of the md5 command line utility
   is available from http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/. winMd5Sum is a
   graphical MD5 checking tool that can be obtained from
   http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/winmd5sum. Our Microsoft
   Windows examples will assume the name md5.exe.

   Linux and Microsoft Windows examples:
shell> md5sum mysql-standard-5.6.18-linux-i686.tar.gz
aaab65abbec64d5e907dcd41b8699945  mysql-standard-5.6.18-linux-i686.ta
r.gz
shell> md5.exe mysql-installer-community-5.6.18.msi
aaab65abbec64d5e907dcd41b8699945  mysql-installer-community-5.6.18.ms
i

   You should verify that the resulting checksum (the string of
   hexadecimal digits) matches the one displayed on the download page
   immediately below the respective package.
   Note

   Make sure to verify the checksum of the archive file (for example,
   the .zip, .tar.gz, or .msi file) and not of the files that are
   contained inside of the archive. In other words, verify the file
   before extracting its contents.

2.1.4.2 Signature Checking Using GnuPG

   Another method of verifying the integrity and authenticity of a
   package is to use cryptographic signatures. This is more reliable
   than using MD5 checksums, but requires more work.

   We sign MySQL downloadable packages with GnuPG (GNU Privacy
   Guard). GnuPG is an Open Source alternative to the well-known
   Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) by Phil Zimmermann. See
   http://www.gnupg.org/ for more information about GnuPG and how to
   obtain and install it on your system. Most Linux distributions
   ship with GnuPG installed by default. For more information about
   GnuPG, see http://www.openpgp.org/.

   To verify the signature for a specific package, you first need to
   obtain a copy of our public GPG build key, which you can download
   from http://pgp.mit.edu/. The key that you want to obtain is named
   mysql-build@oss.oracle.com. Alternatively, you can cut and paste
   the key directly from the following text:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.9 (SunOS)

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

   To import the build key into your personal public GPG keyring, use
   gpg --import. For example, if you have saved the key in a file
   named mysql_pubkey.asc, the import command looks like this:
shell> gpg --import mysql_pubkey.asc
gpg: key 5072E1F5: public key "MySQL Release Engineering
<mysql-build@oss.oracle.com>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found

   You can also download the key from the public keyserver using the
   public key id, 5072E1F5:
shell> gpg --recv-keys 5072E1F5
gpg: requesting key 5072E1F5 from hkp server keys.gnupg.net
gpg: key 5072E1F5: "MySQL Release Engineering <mysql-build@oss.oracle
.com>"
1 new user ID
gpg: key 5072E1F5: "MySQL Release Engineering <mysql-build@oss.oracle
.com>"
53 new signatures
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           new user IDs: 1
gpg:         new signatures: 53

   If you want to import the key into your RPM configuration to
   validate RPM install packages, you should be able to import the
   key directly:
shell> rpm --import mysql_pubkey.asc

   If you experience problems or require RPM specific information,
   see Section 2.1.4.4, "Signature Checking Using RPM."

   After you have downloaded and imported the public build key,
   download your desired MySQL package and the corresponding
   signature, which also is available from the download page. The
   signature file has the same name as the distribution file with an
   .asc extension, as shown by the examples in the following table.

   Table 2.1 MySQL Package and Signature Files for Source files
       File Type                      File Name
   Distribution file mysql-standard-5.6.18-linux-i686.tar.gz
   Signature file    mysql-standard-5.6.18-linux-i686.tar.gz.asc

   Make sure that both files are stored in the same directory and
   then run the following command to verify the signature for the
   distribution file:
shell> gpg --verify package_name.asc

   If the downloaded package is valid, you will see a "Good
   signature" similar to:
shell> gpg --verify mysql-standard-5.6.18-linux-i686.tar.gz.asc
gpg: Signature made Tue 01 Feb 2011 02:38:30 AM CST using DSA key ID
5072E1F5
gpg: Good signature from "MySQL Release Engineering <mysql-build@oss.
oracle.com>"

   The Good signature message indicates that the file signature is
   valid, when compared to the signature listed on our site. But you
   might also see warnings, like so:
shell> gpg --verify mysql-standard-5.6.18-linux-i686.tar.gz.asc
gpg: Signature made Wed 23 Jan 2013 02:25:45 AM PST using DSA key ID
5072E1F5
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
gpg: Good signature from "MySQL Release Engineering <mysql-build@oss.
oracle.com>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to th
e owner.
Primary key fingerprint: A4A9 4068 76FC BD3C 4567  70C8 8C71 8D3B 507
2 E1F5

   That is normal, as they depend on your setup and configuration.
   Here are explanations for these warnings:

     * gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found: This means that the
       specific key is not "ultimately trusted" by you or your web of
       trust, which is okay for the purposes of verifying file
       signatures.

     * WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
       There is no indication that the signature belongs to the
       owner.: This refers to your level of trust in your belief that
       you possess our real public key. This is a personal decision.
       Ideally, a MySQL developer would hand you the key in person,
       but more commonly, you downloaded it. Was the download
       tampered with? Probably not, but this decision is up to you.
       Setting up a web of trust is one method for trusting them.

   See the GPG documentation for more information on how to work with
   public keys.

2.1.4.3 Signature Checking Using Gpg4win for Windows

   The Section 2.1.4.2, "Signature Checking Using GnuPG" section
   describes how to verify MySQL downloads using GPG. That guide also
   applies to Microsoft Windows, but another option is to use a GUI
   tool like Gpg4win (http://www.gpg4win.org/). You may use a
   different tool but our examples are based on Gpg4win, and utilize
   its bundled Kleopatra GUI.

   Download and install Gpg4win, and then load Kleopatra. The dialog
   should look similar to:

   Figure 2.1 Initial screen after loading Kleopatra
   Initial screen after loading Kleopatra

   Next, add the MySQL Release Engineering certificate. Do this by
   clicking File, Lookup Certificates on Server. Type "Mysql Release
   Engineering" into the search box and press Search.

   Figure 2.2 Finding the MySQL Release Engineering certificate
   Finding the MySQL Release Engineering certificate

   Select the "MySQL Release Engineering" certificate. The
   Fingerprint and Key-ID must be "5072E1F5", or choose Details... to
   confirm the certificate is valid. Now, import it by clicking
   Import. An import dialog will be displayed, choose Okay, and this
   certificate will now be listed under the Imported Certificates
   tab.

   Next, configure the trust level for our certificate. Select our
   certificate, then from the main menu select Certificates, Change
   Owner Trust.... We suggest choosing I believe checks are very
   accurate for our certificate, as otherwise you might not be able
   to verify our signature. Select I believe checks are very accurate
   and then press OK.

   Figure 2.3 Changing the Trust level
   Changing the Trust level

   Next, verify the downloaded MySQL package file. This requires
   files for both the packaged file, and the signature. The signature
   file must have the same name as the packaged file but with an
   appended .asc extension, as shown by the example in the following
   table. The signature is linked to on the downloads page for each
   MySQL product. You must create the .asc file with this signature.

   Table 2.2 MySQL Package and Signature Files for MySQL Installer
   for Microsoft Windows
       File Type                    File Name
   Distribution file mysql-installer-community-5.6.18.msi
   Signature file    mysql-installer-community-5.6.18.msi.asc

   Make sure that both files are stored in the same directory and
   then run the following command to verify the signature for the
   distribution file. Either drag and drop the signature (.asc) file
   into Kleopatra, or load the dialog from File, Decrypt/Verify
   Files..., and then choose either the .msi or .asc file.

   Figure 2.4 The Decrypt/Verify Files dialog
   The Decrypt/Verify Files dialog

   Click Decrypt/Verify to check the file. The two most common
   results will look like the following, and although the yellow
   warning looks problematic, the following means that the file check
   passed with success. You may now run this installer.

   Figure 2.5 The Decrypt/Verify Results: Good
   The Decrypt/Verify Results: Good

   Seeing a red "The signature is bad" error means the file is
   invalid. Do not execute the MSI file if you see this error.

   Figure 2.6 The Decrypt/Verify Results: Bad
   The Decrypt/Verify Results: Bad

   The Section 2.1.4.2, "Signature Checking Using GnuPG" section
   explains why you probably don't see a green Good signature result.

2.1.4.4 Signature Checking Using RPM

   For RPM packages, there is no separate signature. RPM packages
   have a built-in GPG signature and MD5 checksum. You can verify a
   package by running the following command:
shell> rpm --checksig package_name.rpm

   Example:
shell> rpm --checksig MySQL-server-5.6.18-0.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm
MySQL-server-5.6.18-0.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm: md5 gpg OK

   Note

   If you are using RPM 4.1 and it complains about (GPG) NOT OK
   (MISSING KEYS: GPG#5072e1f5), even though you have imported the
   MySQL public build key into your own GPG keyring, you need to
   import the key into the RPM keyring first. RPM 4.1 no longer uses
   your personal GPG keyring (or GPG itself). Rather, RPM maintains a
   separate keyring because it is a system-wide application and a
   user's GPG public keyring is a user-specific file. To import the
   MySQL public key into the RPM keyring, first obtain the key, then
   use rpm --import to import the key. For example:
shell> gpg --export -a 5072e1f5 > 5072e1f5.asc
shell> rpm --import 5072e1f5.asc

   Alternatively, rpm also supports loading the key directly from a
   URL, and you can use this manual page:
shell> rpm --import http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/checking-g
pg-signature.html

   If you need to obtain the MySQL public key, see Section 2.1.4.2,
   "Signature Checking Using GnuPG."

2.1.5 Installation Layouts

   The installation layout differs for different installation types
   (for example, native packages, binary tarballs, and source
   tarballs), which can lead to confusion when managing different
   systems or using different installation sources. The individual
   layouts are given in the corresponding installation type or
   platform chapter, as described following. Note that the layout of
   installations from vendors other than Oracle may differ from these
   layouts.

     * Section 2.3.1, "MySQL Installation Layout on Microsoft
       Windows"

     * Section 2.8.1, "MySQL Layout for Source Installation"

     * Section 2.2, "MySQL Installation Layout for Generic Unix/Linux
       Binary Package"

     * Section 2.5.3, "MySQL Installation Layout for Linux RPM
       Packages"

     * Section 2.4.2, "MySQL Installation Layout on Mac OS X"

2.1.6 Compiler-Specific Build Characteristics

   In some cases, the compiler used to build MySQL affects the
   features available for use. The notes in this section apply for
   binary distributions provided by Oracle Corporation or that you
   compile yourself from source.

   icc (Intel C++ Compiler) Builds

   A server built with icc has these characteristics:

     * SSL support is not included.

2.2 Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries

   Oracle provides a set of binary distributions of MySQL. These
   include binary distributions in the form of compressed tar files
   (files with a .tar.gz extension) for a number of platforms, as
   well as binaries in platform-specific package formats for selected
   platforms.

   This section covers the installation of MySQL from a compressed
   tar file binary distribution. For other platform-specific package
   formats, see the other platform-specific sections. For example,
   for Windows distributions, see Section 2.3, "Installing MySQL on
   Microsoft Windows."

   To obtain MySQL, see Section 2.1.3, "How to Get MySQL."

   MySQL compressed tar file binary distributions have names of the
   form mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz, where VERSION is a number (for
   example, 5.6.18), and OS indicates the type of operating system
   for which the distribution is intended (for example, pc-linux-i686
   or winx64).

   To install MySQL from a compressed tar file binary distribution,
   your system must have GNU gunzip to uncompress the distribution
   and a reasonable tar to unpack it. If your tar program supports
   the z option, it can both uncompress and unpack the file.

   GNU tar is known to work. The standard tar provided with some
   operating systems is not able to unpack the long file names in the
   MySQL distribution. You should download and install GNU tar, or if
   available, use a preinstalled version of GNU tar. Usually this is
   available as gnutar, gtar, or as tar within a GNU or Free Software
   directory, such as /usr/sfw/bin or /usr/local/bin. GNU tar is
   available from http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/.
   Warning

   If you have previously installed MySQL using your operating system
   native package management system, such as yum or apt-get, you may
   experience problems installing using a native binary. Make sure
   your previous MySQL previous installation has been removed
   entirely (using your package management system), and that any
   additional files, such as old versions of your data files, have
   also been removed. You should also check the existence of
   configuration files such as /etc/my.cnf or the /etc/mysql
   directory have been deleted.

   If you run into problems and need to file a bug report, please use
   the instructions in Section 1.7, "How to Report Bugs or Problems."

   On Unix, to install a compressed tar file binary distribution,
   unpack it at the installation location you choose (typically
   /usr/local/mysql). This creates the directories shown in the
   following table.

   Table 2.3 MySQL Installation Layout for Generic Unix/Linux Binary
   Package
   Directory Contents of Directory
   bin Client programs and the mysqld server
   data Log files, databases
   docs Manual in Info format
   man Unix manual pages
   include Include (header) files
   lib Libraries
   scripts mysql_install_db
   share Miscellaneous support files, including error messages,
   sample configuration files, SQL for database installation
   sql-bench Benchmarks

   Debug versions of the mysqld binary are available as mysqld-debug.
   To compile your own debug version of MySQL from a source
   distribution, use the appropriate configuration options to enable
   debugging support. For more information on compiling from source,
   see Section 2.8, "Installing MySQL from Source."

   To install and use a MySQL binary distribution, the basic command
   sequence looks like this:
shell> groupadd mysql
shell> useradd -r -g mysql mysql
shell> cd /usr/local
shell> tar zxvf /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz
shell> ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql
shell> cd mysql
shell> chown -R mysql .
shell> chgrp -R mysql .
shell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
shell> chown -R root .
shell> chown -R mysql data
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
# Next command is optional
shell> cp support-files/mysql.server /etc/init.d/mysql.server

   mysql_install_db creates a default option file named my.cnf in the
   base installation directory. This file is created from a template
   included in the distribution package named my-default.cnf. For
   more information, see Section 5.1.2.2, "Using a Sample Default
   Server Configuration File."

   A more detailed version of the preceding description for
   installing a binary distribution follows.
   Note

   This procedure assumes that you have root (administrator) access
   to your system. Alternatively, you can prefix each command using
   the sudo (Linux) or pfexec (OpenSolaris) command.

   The procedure does not set up any passwords for MySQL accounts.
   After following the procedure, proceed to Section 2.9.2, "Securing
   the Initial MySQL Accounts."

Create a mysql User and Group

   If your system does not already have a user and group for mysqld
   to run as, you may need to create one. The following commands add
   the mysql group and the mysql user. You might want to call the
   user and group something else instead of mysql. If so, substitute
   the appropriate name in the following instructions. The syntax for
   useradd and groupadd may differ slightly on different versions of
   Unix, or they may have different names such as adduser and
   addgroup.
shell> groupadd mysql
shell> useradd -r -g mysql mysql

   Note

   Because the user is required only for ownership purposes, not
   login purposes, the useradd command uses the -r option to create a
   user that does not have login permissions to your server host.
   Omit this option to permit logins for the user (or if your useradd
   does not support the option).

Obtain and Unpack the Distribution

   Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the distribution
   and change location into it. The example here unpacks the
   distribution under /usr/local. The instructions, therefore, assume
   that you have permission to create files and directories in
   /usr/local. If that directory is protected, you must perform the
   installation as root.
shell> cd /usr/local

   Obtain a distribution file using the instructions in Section
   2.1.3, "How to Get MySQL." For a given release, binary
   distributions for all platforms are built from the same MySQL
   source distribution.

   Unpack the distribution, which creates the installation directory.
   Then create a symbolic link to that directory. tar can uncompress
   and unpack the distribution if it has z option support:
shell> tar zxvf /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz
shell> ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql

   The tar command creates a directory named mysql-VERSION-OS. The ln
   command makes a symbolic link to that directory. This enables you
   to refer more easily to the installation directory as
   /usr/local/mysql.

   If your tar does not have z option support, use gunzip to unpack
   the distribution and tar to unpack it. Replace the preceding tar
   command with the following alternative command to uncompress and
   extract the distribution:
shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Perform Postinstallation Setup

   The remainder of the installation process involves setting up the
   configuration file, creating the core databases, and starting the
   MySQL server. For next steps, see Section 2.9, "Postinstallation
   Setup and Testing."
   Note

   The accounts that are listed in the MySQL grant tables initially
   have no passwords. After starting the server, you should set up
   passwords for them using the instructions in Section 2.9.2,
   "Securing the Initial MySQL Accounts."

2.3 Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows

   MySQL is available for Microsoft Windows, for both 32-bit and
   64-bit versions. For supported Windows platform information, see
   http://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html.

   It is possible to run MySQL as a standard application or as a
   Windows service. By using a service, you can monitor and control
   the operation of the server through the standard Windows service
   management tools. For more information, see Section 2.3.5.7,
   "Starting MySQL as a Windows Service."

   Generally, you should install MySQL on Windows using an account
   that has administrator rights. Otherwise, you may encounter
   problems with certain operations such as editing the PATH
   environment variable or accessing the Service Control Manager.
   Once installed, MySQL does not need to be executed using a user
   with Administrator privileges.

   For a list of limitations on the use of MySQL on the Windows
   platform, see Section E.10.6, "Windows Platform Limitations."

   In addition to the MySQL Server package, you may need or want
   additional components to use MySQL with your application or
   development environment. These include, but are not limited to:

     * To connect to the MySQL server using ODBC, you must have a
       Connector/ODBC driver. For more information, including
       installation and configuration instructions, see MySQL
       Connector/ODBC Developer Guide
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/index.html). But
       note that MySQL Installer will install and configure
       Connector/ODBC for you.

     * To use MySQL server with .NET applications, you must have the
       Connector/Net driver. For more information, including
       installation and configuration instructions, see MySQL
       Connector/Net Developer Guide
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/index.html). But
       note that MySQL Installer will install and configure
       Connector/NET for you.

   MySQL distributions for Windows can be downloaded from
   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/. See Section 2.1.3, "How to Get
   MySQL."

   MySQL for Windows is available in several distribution formats,
   detailed following. Generally speaking, you should use MySQL
   Installer. It is simpler to use than the Zip file, and you need no
   additional tools to get MySQL up and running. MySQL Installer
   automatically installs MySQL Server and additional MySQL products,
   creates an options file, starts the server, and enables you to
   create default user accounts. For more information on choosing a
   package, see Section 2.3.2, "Choosing An Installation Package."

     * A MySQL Installer distribution includes MySQL Server and
       additional MySQL products including MySQL Workbench, MySQL
       Notifier, and MySQL for Excel. MySQL Installer can also be
       used to upgrade these products in the future.
       For instructions on installing MySQL using MySQL Installer,
       see Section 2.3.3, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows
       Using MySQL Installer."

     * The standard binary distribution (packaged as a Zip file)
       contains all of the necessary files that you unpack into your
       chosen location. This package contains all of the files in the
       full Windows MSI Installer package, but does not include an
       installation program.
       For instructions on installing MySQL using the Zip file, see
       Section 2.3.5, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a
       noinstall Zip Archive."

     * The source distribution format contains all the code and
       support files for building the executables using the Visual
       Studio compiler system.
       For instructions on building MySQL from source on Windows, see
       Section 2.8, "Installing MySQL from Source."

   MySQL on Windows considerations:

     * Large Table Support
       If you need tables with a size larger than 4GB, install MySQL
       on an NTFS or newer file system. Do not forget to use MAX_ROWS
       and AVG_ROW_LENGTH when you create tables. See Section
       13.1.17, "CREATE TABLE Syntax."

     * MySQL and Virus Checking Software
       Virus-scanning software such as Norton/Symantec Anti-Virus on
       directories containing MySQL data and temporary tables can
       cause issues, both in terms of the performance of MySQL and
       the virus-scanning software misidentifying the contents of the
       files as containing spam. This is due to the fingerprinting
       mechanism used by the virus-scanning software, and the way in
       which MySQL rapidly updates different files, which may be
       identified as a potential security risk.
       After installing MySQL Server, it is recommended that you
       disable virus scanning on the main directory (datadir) used to
       store your MySQL table data. There is usually a system built
       into the virus scanning software to enable specific
       directories to be ignored.
       In addition, by default, MySQL creates temporary files in the
       standard Windows temporary directory. To prevent the temporary
       files also being scanned, configure a separate temporary
       directory for MySQL temporary files and add this directory to
       the virus scanning exclusion list. To do this, add a
       configuration option for the tmpdir parameter to your my.ini
       configuration file. For more information, see Section 2.3.5.2,
       "Creating an Option File."

2.3.1 MySQL Installation Layout on Microsoft Windows

   For MySQL 5.6 on Windows, the default installation directory is
   C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6. Some Windows users prefer
   to install in C:\mysql, the directory that formerly was used as
   the default. However, the layout of the subdirectories remains the
   same.

   All of the files are located within this parent directory, using
   the structure shown in the following table.

   Table 2.4 Default MySQL Installation Layout for Microsoft Windows
   Directory Contents of Directory Notes

   installation

   If you install MySQL using the MySQL Installer, this package
   creates and sets up the data directory that the installed server
   will use, and also creates a pristine "template" data directory
   named data under the installation directory. After an installation
   has been performed using this package, the template data directory
   can be copied to set up additional MySQL instances. See Section
   5.3, "Running Multiple MySQL Instances on One Machine."

2.3.2 Choosing An Installation Package

   For MySQL 5.6, there are installation package formats to choose
   from when installing MySQL on Windows:

     * MySQL Installer: This package has a file name similar to
       mysql-installer-community-5.6.18.0.msi or
       mysql-installer-commercial-5.6.18.0.msi, and utilizes MSI's to
       automatically install MySQL server and other products. It will
       download and apply updates to itself, and for each of the
       installed products. It also configures the additional
       non-server products.
       The installed products are configurable, and this includes:
       documentation with samples and examples, connectors (such as
       C, C++, J, NET, and ODBC), MySQL Workbench, MySQL Notifier for
       Microsoft Windows, MySQL for Excel, and the MySQL Server with
       its components.
       MySQL Installer will run on all Windows platforms that are
       supported by MySQL (see
       http://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html)
       .
       Note
       Because MySQL Installer is not a native component of Microsoft
       Windows and depends on .NET, it will not work on minimal
       installation options like the "Server Core" version of Windows
       Server 2008.
       For instructions on installing MySQL using MySQL Installer,
       see Section 2.3.3, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows
       Using MySQL Installer."

     * The Noinstall Archive: This package has a file name similar to
       mysql-5.6.18-win32.zip or mysql-5.6.18-winx64.zip, and
       contains all the files found in the Complete install package,
       with the exception of the GUI. This package does not include
       an automated installer, and must be manually installed and
       configured.

   Your choice of install package affects the installation process
   you must follow. If you choose to use MySQL Installer, see Section
   2.3.3, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using MySQL
   Installer." If you choose to install a Noinstall archive, see
   Section 2.3.5, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a
   noinstall Zip Archive."

2.3.3 Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using MySQL Installer

   MySQL Installer is an application that simplifies the installation
   and updating process for a wide range of MySQL products, including
   MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows, MySQL Workbench, and MySQL
   for Excel. From this central application, you can see which MySQL
   products are already installed, configure them, and update or
   remove them if necessary. The installer can also install plugins,
   documentation, tutorials, and example databases. The MySQL
   Installer is only available for Microsoft Windows, and includes
   both a GUI and command-line interface.

Installer package types


     * Full: Bundles all of the MySQL products (including MySQL
       Server). The file is over 160MB, and have names of the form
       mysql-installer-community-VERSION.N.msi where VERSION is the
       MySQL Server version number such as 5.6 and N is the package
       number, which begins at 0.

     * Web: Only contains the Installer and configuration files, and
       it only downloads the MySQL products you choose to install.
       The file is about 2MB, and have names of the form
       mysql-installer-community-web-VERSION.N.msi where VERSION is
       the MySQL Server version number such as 5.6 and N is the
       package number, which begins at 0.

Installer editions


     * Community edition: Downloadable at
       http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/. It installs the
       community edition of all MySQL products.

     * Commercial edition: Downloadable at either My Oracle Support
       (https://support.oracle.com/) (MOS) or
       https://edelivery.oracle.com/. It installs the commercial
       version of all MySQL products, including Workbench SE. It also
       integrates with your MOS account, so enter in your MOS
       credentials to automatically receive updates for your
       commercial MySQL products.

   For release notes detailing the changes in each release of MySQL
   Installer, see MySQL Installer Release Notes
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql-installer/en/).

   MySQL Installer is compatible with pre-existing installations, and
   adds them to its list of installed components. And while the MySQL
   Installer is bundled with a specific version of MySQL Server, a
   single MySQL Installer instance can install and manage multiple
   MySQL Server versions. For example, a single MySQL Installer
   instance can install versions 5.1, 5.5, and 5.6. It can also
   manage either commercial or community editions of the MySQL
   Server.
   Note

   A single host can not have both community and commercial editions
   of MySQL Server installed. For example, if you want both MySQL
   Server 5.5 and 5.6 installed on a single host, then both must be
   the same commercial or community edition.

   MySQL Installer handles the initial configuration and setup of the
   applications. For example:

    1. It will create MySQL Server connections in MySQL Workbench.

    2. It creates the configuration file (my.ini) that is used to
       configure the MySQL Server. The values written to this file
       are influenced by choices you make during the installation
       process.

    3. It imports example databases.

    4. It creates MySQL Server user accounts with configurable
       permissions based on general roles, such as DB Administrator,
       DB Designer, and Backup Admin. It optionally creates a Windows
       user named MysqlSys with limited privileges, which would then
       run the MySQL Server.
       This feature is only available during the initial installation
       of the MySQL Server, and not during future updates. User
       accounts may also be added with MySQL Workbench.

    5. If the "Advanced Configuration" option is checked, then the
       Logging Options are also configured. This includes defining
       file paths for the error log, general log, slow query log
       (including the configuration of seconds it requires to execute
       a query), and the binary log.

   MySQL Installer can optionally check for updated components and
   download them for you automatically.

2.3.3.1 MySQL Installer GUI

   After installation of the GUI version, the installer will have add
   its own Start Menu item under MySQL.
   Note

   Files that are generated by MySQL Installer grant full permissions
   to the user that executes MySQL Installer, including my.ini. This
   does not apply to files and directories for specific products such
   as the MySQL Server data directory in ProgramData, that is owned
   by SYSTEM.

   After the installer itself has been installed and started, the
   following screen is displayed:

   Figure 2.7 MySQL Installer - Welcome Screen
   MySQL Installer - Welcome Screen

   There are three main options:

    1. Install MySQL Products - The Installation Wizard.

    2. About MySQL - Learn about MySQL products and features.

    3. Resources - Information to help install and configure MySQL.

   To Install MySQL Products after executing MySQL Installer for the
   first time, you must accept the license agreement before
   proceeding with the installation process.

   Figure 2.8 MySQL Installer - License Agreement
   MySQL Installer - License Agreement

   If you are connected to the Internet, then the Installer will
   search for the latest MySQL components and add them to the
   installation bundle. Click Connect to the Internet to complete
   this step, or otherwise check the Skip checkbox and then Continue.

   Figure 2.9 MySQL Installer - Find latest products
   MySQL Installer - Find latest products

   If you chose "Connect to the Internet," the next page will show
   the progress of MySQL Installer's search for available updates.
   When the search is complete (or if you opted to skip the search),
   you will be taken to the Choose Setup Type page:

   Figure 2.10 MySQL Installer - Choosing a Setup Type
   MySQL Installer - Choosing a Setup Type

   Determine the option most compatible with your preferences by
   reading the Setup Type Description descriptions.

   The Installation and Data paths are also defined here, and a
   caution flag will notify you if the data path you define already
   exists.

   After you select a setup type, the MySQL Installer will check your
   system for the necessary external requirements and download then
   install missing components onto your system.

   Figure 2.11 MySQL Installer - Check Requirements
   MySQL Installer - Check Requirements

   The next window lists the MySQL products that are scheduled to be
   installed:

   Figure 2.12 MySQL Installer - Installation Progress
   MySQL Installer - Installation Progress

   As components are installed, you'll see their status change from
   "to be installed" to "install success."

   Figure 2.13 MySQL Installer - Installation Progress status
   MySQL Installer - Installation Progress status

   After all components are installed, the next step involves
   configuring the products. The Configuration Overview window
   displays the progress and then loads a configuration window if it
   is required.

   Figure 2.14 MySQL Installer - Configuration Overview
   MySQL Installer - Configuration Overview

   The ideal MySQL Server configuration depends on your intended use,
   as explained in the next window. Choose the description that most
   closely applies to your machine.

   You may enable TCP/IP Networking here as otherwise only localhost
   connections are allowed.

   Checking the "Advanced Configuration" option provides additional
   Logging Options to configure. This includes defining file paths
   for the error log, general log, slow query log (including the
   configuration of seconds it requires to execute a query), and the
   binary log.

   Figure 2.15 MySQL Installer - MySQL Server Configuration: Define
   platform, networking, and logging options
   MySQL Installer- MySQL Server Configuration: Define platform,
   networking, and logging options

   Next, choose your account information. Defining a root password is
   required, whereas it's optional to create additional users. There
   are several different predefined user roles that each have
   different permission levels. For example, a "DB Admin" will have
   more privileges than a "DB Designer.".

   Figure 2.16 MySQL Installer - MySQL Server Configuration: User
   accounts
   MySQL Installer - MySQL Server Configuration: User accounts
   Note

   If the MySQL Server is already installed, then the Current Root
   Password will also be needed.

   Next, configure the Windows Service Details. This includes the
   service name, how the MySQL Server should be loaded at startup,
   and how the Windows Service for MySQL Server will be run.

   Figure 2.17 MySQL Installer - MySQL Server Configuration: Windows
   service details
   MySQL Installer - MySQL Server Configuration: Windows service
   details
   Note

   When configuring Run Windows Services as ... using a Custom User,
   the custom user must have privileges to log on to Windows as a
   service. And the Next button will be disabled until this user is
   given these user rights.

   On Microsoft Windows 7, this is configured by loading the Start
   Menu, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Local Security Policy,
   Local Policies, User Rights Assignment, then Log On As A Service.
   Choose Add User or Group here to add the custom user, and then OK,
   OK to save.

   The final configuration step is available if the Advanced
   Configuration option was checked, and it includes configuration
   options related to log file names:

   Figure 2.18 MySQL Installer - MySQL Server Configuration: Logging
   options
   MySQL Installer - MySQL Server Configuration: Logging options

   After the MySQL Installer configuration process is completed, you
   may save the installation log, and then load MySQL Workbench if
   the Start MySQL Workbench after Setup option is checked:

   Figure 2.19 MySQL Installer - Installation Complete
   MySQL Installer - Installation Complete

   You can now open MySQL Installer from the Microsoft Windows Start
   menu under the MySQL group, which will load the MySQL Installer
   Maintenance Screen. This is used to add, update, and remove
   features.

   Figure 2.20 MySQL Installer - Maintenance Screen
   MySQL Installer - Maintenance Screen
   Note

   An Update Screen screen is shown if MySQL Installer is used on a
   machine with older products installed, as opposed to the
   Maintenance Screen shown above. However, the functionality remains
   the same.

   Add/Modify Products and Features will list all installed and
   available MySQL products.

   Figure 2.21 MySQL Installer - Add/Modify Products and Features
   MySQL Installer - Add/Modify Products and Features

   The installation is now complete. MySQL Server should be running,
   and most MySQL products installed and available for use.

   See also the MySQL Workbench documentation
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/).

2.3.3.2 MySQL Installer Console

   MySQLInstallerConsole provides functionality similar to the GUI
   version of MySQL Installer, but from the command-line. It is
   installed when MySQL Installer is initially executed, and then
   available within the MySQL Installer directory. Typically that is
   in C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Installer\, and the console
   must be executed with administrative privileges.

   To use, invoke the Command Prompt with administrative privileges
   by choosing Start, Accessories, then right-click on Command Prompt
   and choose Run as administrator. And from the command-line,
   optionally change the directory to where MySQLInstallerConsole is
   located:
C:\> cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Installer"

   MySQLInstallerConsole supports the following options, which are
   specified on the command line:

     * --help, -h, or -?
       Displays a help message with usage examples, and then exits.
C:\> MySQLInstallerConsole --help

       tokens=tokens
       Creates a new user.
       Requires: name, host, role, and the password or tokens. Tokens
       are separated by pipe ("|") characters.

2.3.4 MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows

   The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows is a tool that enables
   you to monitor and adjust the status of your local and remote
   MySQL Server instances through an indicator that resides in the
   system tray. The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows also gives
   quick access to several MySQL GUI tools (such as MySQL Workbench)
   through its context menu.

   The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows is installed by MySQL
   Installer, and (by default) will start-up when Microsoft Windows
   is started.
   Note

   To install, download and execute the MySQL Installer
   (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/), be sure the MySQL
   Notifier for Microsoft Windows product is selected, then proceed
   with the installation. See the MySQL Installer manual for
   additional details.

   For release notes detailing the changes in each release of MySQL
   Notifier for Microsoft Windows, see the MySQL Notifier Release
   Notes (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql-notifier/en/).

   Visit the MySQL Notifier forum
   (http://forums.mysql.com/list.php?173) for additional MySQL
   Notifier for Microsoft Windows help and support.

   Features include:

     * Start, Stop, and Restart instances of the MySQL Server.

     * Automatically detects (and adds) new MySQL Server services.
       These are listed under Manage Monitored Items, and may also be
       configured.

     * The Tray icon changes, depending on the status. It's green if
       all monitored MySQL Server instances are running, or red if at
       least one service is stopped. The Update MySQL Notifier tray
       icon based on service status option, which dictates this
       behavior, is enabled by default for each service.

     * Links to other applications like MySQL Workbench, MySQL
       Installer, and the MySQL Utilities. For example, choosing
       Configure Instance will load the MySQL Workbench Server
       Administration window for that particular instance.

     * If MySQL Workbench is also installed, then the Configure
       Instance and SQL Editor options are available for local (but
       not remote) MySQL instances.

     * Monitoring of both local and remote MySQL instances.

   Note

   Remote monitoring is available since MySQL Notifier for Microsoft
   Windows 1.1.0.

   The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows resides in the system
   tray and provides visual status information for your MySQL Server
   instances. A green icon is displayed at the top left corner of the
   tray icon if the current MySQL Server is running, or a red icon if
   the service is stopped.

   The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows automatically adds
   discovered MySQL Services on the local machine, and each service
   is saved and configurable. By default, the Automatically add new
   services whose name contains option is enabled and set to mysql.
   Related Notifications Options include being notified when new
   services are either discovered or experience status changes, and
   are also enabled by default. And uninstalling a service will also
   remove the service from the MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows.
   Note

   The Automatically add new services whose name contains option
   default changed from ".*mysqld.*" to "mysql" in Notifier 1.1.0.

   Clicking the system tray icon will reveal several options, as seen
   in the screenshots below:

   The Service Instance menu is the main MySQL Notifier for Microsoft
   Windows window, and enables you to Stop, Start, and Restart the
   MySQL Server.

   The Actions menu includes several links to external applications
   (if they are installed), and a a Refresh Status option to manually
   refresh the status of all monitored services (in both local and
   remote computers) and MySQL instances.
   Note

   The main menu will not show the Actions menu when there are no
   services being monitored by MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows.
   Note

   The Refresh Status feature is available since MySQL Notifier for
   Microsoft Windows 1.1.0.

       Windows services for the Add New Service dialog.
       Prior to version 1.1.0, this option was named "Automatically
       add new services that match this pattern."

     * Notify me when a service is automatically added: Will display
       a balloon notification from the taskbar when a newly
       discovered service is added to the monitored services list.

     * Notify me when a service changes status: Will display a
       balloon notification from the taskbar when a monitored service
       changes its status.

2.3.4.1 Remote monitoring set up and installation instructions

   The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows uses Windows Management
   Instrumentation (WMI) to manage and monitor services in remote
   computers running Windows XP or later. This guide explains how it
   works, and how to set up your system to monitor remote MySQL
   instances.
   Note

   Remote monitoring is available since MySQL Notifier for Microsoft
   Windows 1.1.0.

   In order to configure WMI, it is important to understand that the
   underlying Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) architecture
   is doing the WMI work. Specifically, MySQL Notifier for Microsoft
   Windows is using asynchronous notification queries on remote
   Microsoft Windows hosts as .NET events. These events send an
   asynchronous callback to the computer running the MySQL Notifier
   for Microsoft Windows so it knows when a service status has
   changed on the remote computer. Asynchronous notifications offer
   the best performance compared to semi-synchronous notifications or
   synchronous notifications that use timers.

   Asynchronous notifications requires the remote computer to send a
   callback to the client computer (thus opening a reverse
   connection), so the Windows Firewall and DCOM settings must be
   properly configured for the communication to function properly.

   Figure 2.29 MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows Distributed
   Component Object Model (DCOM)
   MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows Distributed Component Object
   Model (DCOM)

   Most of the common errors thrown by asynchronous WMI notifications
   are related to Windows Firewall blocking the communication, or to
   DCOM / WMI settings not being set up properly. For a list of
   common errors with solutions, see Section 2.3.4.1, "."

   The following steps are required to make WMI function. These steps
   are divided between two machines. A single host computer that runs
   MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows (Computer A), and multiple
   remote machines that are being monitored (Computer B).

2.3.5 Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a noinstall Zip
Archive

   Users who are installing from the noinstall package can use the
   instructions in this section to manually install MySQL. The
   process for installing MySQL from a Zip archive is as follows:

    1. Extract the archive to the desired install directory

    2. Create an option file

    3. Choose a MySQL server type

    4. Start the MySQL server

    5. Secure the default user accounts

   This process is described in the sections that follow.

2.3.5.1 Extracting the Install Archive

   To install MySQL manually, do the following:

    1. If you are upgrading from a previous version please refer to
       Section 2.3.7, "Upgrading MySQL on Windows," before beginning
       the upgrade process.

    2. Make sure that you are logged in as a user with administrator
       privileges.

    3. Choose an installation location. Traditionally, the MySQL
       server is installed in C:\mysql. The MySQL Installer installs
       MySQL under C:\Program Files\MySQL. If you do not install
       MySQL at C:\mysql, you must specify the path to the install
       directory during startup or in an option file. See Section
       2.3.5.2, "Creating an Option File."

    4. Extract the install archive to the chosen installation
       location using your preferred Zip archive tool. Some tools may
       extract the archive to a folder within your chosen
       installation location. If this occurs, you can move the
       contents of the subfolder into the chosen installation
       location.

2.3.5.2 Creating an Option File

   If you need to specify startup options when you run the server,
   you can indicate them on the command line or place them in an
   option file. For options that are used every time the server
   starts, you may find it most convenient to use an option file to
   specify your MySQL configuration. This is particularly true under
   the following circumstances:

     * The installation or data directory locations are different
       from the default locations (C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL
       Server 5.6 and C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\data).

     * You need to tune the server settings, such as memory, cache,
       or InnoDB configuration information.

   When the MySQL server starts on Windows, it looks for option files
   in several locations, such as the Windows directory, C:\, and the
   MySQL installation directory (for the full list of locations, see
   Section 4.2.3.3, "Using Option Files"). The Windows directory
   typically is named something like C:\WINDOWS. You can determine
   its exact location from the value of the WINDIR environment
   variable using the following command:
C:\> echo %WINDIR%

   MySQL looks for options in each location first in the my.ini file,
   and then in the my.cnf file. However, to avoid confusion, it is
   best if you use only one file. If your PC uses a boot loader where
   C: is not the boot drive, your only option is to use the my.ini
   file. Whichever option file you use, it must be a plain text file.
   Note

   When using the MySQL Installer to install MySQL Server, it will
   create the my.ini at the default location. And as of MySQL Server
   5.5.27, the user running MySQL Installer is granted full
   permissions to this new my.ini.

   In other words, be sure that the MySQL Server user has permission
   to read the my.ini file.

   You can also make use of the example option files included with
   your MySQL distribution; see Section 5.1.2, "Server Configuration
   Defaults."

   An option file can be created and modified with any text editor,
   such as Notepad. For example, if MySQL is installed in E:\mysql
   and the data directory is in E:\mydata\data, you can create an
   option file containing a [mysqld] section to specify values for
   the basedir and datadir options:
[mysqld]
# set basedir to your installation path
basedir=E:/mysql
# set datadir to the location of your data directory
datadir=E:/mydata/data

   Note that Windows path names are specified in option files using
   (forward) slashes rather than backslashes. If you do use
   backslashes, double them:
[mysqld]
# set basedir to your installation path
basedir=E:\\mysql
# set datadir to the location of your data directory
datadir=E:\\mydata\\data

   The rules for use of backslash in option file values are given in
   Section 4.2.3.3, "Using Option Files."

   The data directory is located within the AppData directory for the
   user running MySQL.

   If you would like to use a data directory in a different location,
   you should copy the entire contents of the data directory to the
   new location. For example, if you want to use E:\mydata as the
   data directory instead, you must do two things:

    1. Move the entire data directory and all of its contents from
       the default location (for example C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL
       Server 5.6\data) to E:\mydata.

    2. Use a --datadir option to specify the new data directory
       location each time you start the server.

2.3.5.3 Selecting a MySQL Server Type

   The following table shows the available servers for Windows in
   MySQL 5.6.
   Binary Description
   mysqld Optimized binary with named-pipe support
   mysqld-debug Like mysqld, but compiled with full debugging and
   automatic memory allocation checking

   All of the preceding binaries are optimized for modern Intel
   processors, but should work on any Intel i386-class or higher
   processor.

   Each of the servers in a distribution support the same set of
   storage engines. The SHOW ENGINES statement displays which engines
   a given server supports.

   All Windows MySQL 5.6 servers have support for symbolic linking of
   database directories.

   MySQL supports TCP/IP on all Windows platforms. MySQL servers on
   Windows also support named pipes, if you start the server with the
   --enable-named-pipe option. It is necessary to use this option
   explicitly because some users have experienced problems with
   shutting down the MySQL server when named pipes were used. The
   default is to use TCP/IP regardless of platform because named
   pipes are slower than TCP/IP in many Windows configurations.

2.3.5.4 Starting the Server for the First Time

   This section gives a general overview of starting the MySQL
   server. The following sections provide more specific information
   for starting the MySQL server from the command line or as a
   Windows service.

   The information here applies primarily if you installed MySQL
   using the Noinstall version, or if you wish to configure and test
   MySQL manually rather than with the GUI tools.
   Note

   The MySQL server will automatically start after using the MySQL
   Installer, and the MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows GUI can be
   used to start/stop/restart at any time.

   The examples in these sections assume that MySQL is installed
   under the default location of C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
   5.6. Adjust the path names shown in the examples if you have MySQL
   installed in a different location.

   Clients have two options. They can use TCP/IP, or they can use a
   named pipe if the server supports named-pipe connections.

   MySQL for Windows also supports shared-memory connections if the
   server is started with the --shared-memory option. Clients can
   connect through shared memory by using the --protocol=MEMORY
   option.

   For information about which server binary to run, see Section
   2.3.5.3, "Selecting a MySQL Server Type."

   Testing is best done from a command prompt in a console window (or
   "DOS window"). In this way you can have the server display status
   messages in the window where they are easy to see. If something is
   wrong with your configuration, these messages make it easier for
   you to identify and fix any problems.

   To start the server, enter this command:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqld" --console

   For a server that includes InnoDB support, you should see the
   messages similar to those following as it starts (the path names
   and sizes may differ):
InnoDB: The first specified datafile c:\ibdata\ibdata1 did not exist:
InnoDB: a new database to be created!
InnoDB: Setting file c:\ibdata\ibdata1 size to 209715200
InnoDB: Database physically writes the file full: wait...
InnoDB: Log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile0 did not exist: new to be creat
ed
InnoDB: Setting log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile0 size to 31457280
InnoDB: Log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile1 did not exist: new to be creat
ed
InnoDB: Setting log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile1 size to 31457280
InnoDB: Log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile2 did not exist: new to be creat
ed
InnoDB: Setting log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile2 size to 31457280
InnoDB: Doublewrite buffer not found: creating new
InnoDB: Doublewrite buffer created
InnoDB: creating foreign key constraint system tables
InnoDB: foreign key constraint system tables created
011024 10:58:25  InnoDB: Started

   When the server finishes its startup sequence, you should see
   something like this, which indicates that the server is ready to
   service client connections:
mysqld: ready for connections
Version: '5.6.18'  socket: ''  port: 3306

   The server continues to write to the console any further
   diagnostic output it produces. You can open a new console window
   in which to run client programs.

   If you omit the --console option, the server writes diagnostic
   output to the error log in the data directory (C:\Program
   Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\data by default). The error log is
   the file with the .err extension, and may be set using the
   --log-error option.
   Note

   The accounts that are listed in the MySQL grant tables initially
   have no passwords. After starting the server, you should set up
   passwords for them using the instructions in Section 2.9.2,
   "Securing the Initial MySQL Accounts."

2.3.5.5 Starting MySQL from the Windows Command Line

   The MySQL server can be started manually from the command line.
   This can be done on any version of Windows.
   Note

   The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows GUI can also be used to
   start/stop/restart the MySQL server.

   To start the mysqld server from the command line, you should start
   a console window (or "DOS window") and enter this command:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqld"

   The path to mysqld may vary depending on the install location of
   MySQL on your system.

   You can stop the MySQL server by executing this command:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqladmin" -u root
 shutdown

   Note

   If the MySQL root user account has a password, you need to invoke
   mysqladmin with the -p option and supply the password when
   prompted.

   This command invokes the MySQL administrative utility mysqladmin
   to connect to the server and tell it to shut down. The command
   connects as the MySQL root user, which is the default
   administrative account in the MySQL grant system. Note that users
   in the MySQL grant system are wholly independent from any login
   users under Windows.

   If mysqld doesn't start, check the error log to see whether the
   server wrote any messages there to indicate the cause of the
   problem. By default, the error log is located in the C:\Program
   Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\data directory. It is the file with a
   suffix of .err, or may be specified by passing in the --log-error
   option. Alternatively, you can try to start the server as mysqld
   --console; in this case, you may get some useful information on
   the screen that may help solve the problem.

   The last option is to start mysqld with the --standalone and
   --debug options. In this case, mysqld writes a log file
   C:\mysqld.trace that should contain the reason why mysqld doesn't
   start. See Section 23.4.3, "The DBUG Package."

   Use mysqld --verbose --help to display all the options that mysqld
   supports.

2.3.5.6 Customizing the PATH for MySQL Tools

   To make it easier to invoke MySQL programs, you can add the path
   name of the MySQL bin directory to your Windows system PATH
   environment variable:

     * On the Windows desktop, right-click the My Computer icon, and
       select Properties.

     * Next select the Advanced tab from the System Properties menu
       that appears, and click the Environment Variables button.

     * Under System Variables, select Path, and then click the Edit
       button. The Edit System Variable dialogue should appear.

     * Place your cursor at the end of the text appearing in the
       space marked Variable Value. (Use the End key to ensure that
       your cursor is positioned at the very end of the text in this
       space.) Then enter the complete path name of your MySQL bin
       directory (for example, C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
       5.6\bin)
       Note
       There must be a semicolon separating this path from any values
       present in this field.
       Dismiss this dialogue, and each dialogue in turn, by clicking
       OK until all of the dialogues that were opened have been
       dismissed. You should now be able to invoke any MySQL
       executable program by typing its name at the DOS prompt from
       any directory on the system, without having to supply the
       path. This includes the servers, the mysql client, and all
       MySQL command-line utilities such as mysqladmin and mysqldump.
       You should not add the MySQL bin directory to your Windows
       PATH if you are running multiple MySQL servers on the same
       machine.

   Warning

   You must exercise great care when editing your system PATH by
   hand; accidental deletion or modification of any portion of the
   existing PATH value can leave you with a malfunctioning or even
   unusable system.

2.3.5.7 Starting MySQL as a Windows Service

   On Windows, the recommended way to run MySQL is to install it as a
   Windows service, so that MySQL starts and stops automatically when
   Windows starts and stops. A MySQL server installed as a service
   can also be controlled from the command line using NET commands,
   or with the graphical Services utility. Generally, to install
   MySQL as a Windows service you should be logged in using an
   account that has administrator rights.
   Note

   The MySQL Notifier for Microsoft Windows GUI can also be used to
   monitor the status of the MySQL service.

   The Services utility (the Windows Service Control Manager) can be
   found in the Windows Control Panel (under Administrative Tools on
   Windows 2000, XP, Vista, and Server 2003). To avoid conflicts, it
   is advisable to close the Services utility while performing server
   installation or removal operations from the command line.

Installing the service

   Before installing MySQL as a Windows service, you should first
   stop the current server if it is running by using the following
   command:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqladmin"
          -u root shutdown

   Note

   If the MySQL root user account has a password, you need to invoke
   mysqladmin with the -p option and supply the password when
   prompted.

   This command invokes the MySQL administrative utility mysqladmin
   to connect to the server and tell it to shut down. The command
   connects as the MySQL root user, which is the default
   administrative account in the MySQL grant system. Note that users
   in the MySQL grant system are wholly independent from any login
   users under Windows.

   Install the server as a service using this command:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqld" --install

   The service-installation command does not start the server.
   Instructions for that are given later in this section.

   To make it easier to invoke MySQL programs, you can add the path
   name of the MySQL bin directory to your Windows system PATH
   environment variable:

     * On the Windows desktop, right-click the My Computer icon, and
       select Properties.

     * Next select the Advanced tab from the System Properties menu
       that appears, and click the Environment Variables button.

     * Under System Variables, select Path, and then click the Edit
       button. The Edit System Variable dialogue should appear.

     * Place your cursor at the end of the text appearing in the
       space marked Variable Value. (Use the End key to ensure that
       your cursor is positioned at the very end of the text in this
       space.) Then enter the complete path name of your MySQL bin
       directory (for example, C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server
       5.6\bin), Note that there should be a semicolon separating
       this path from any values present in this field. Dismiss this
       dialogue, and each dialogue in turn, by clicking OK until all
       of the dialogues that were opened have been dismissed. You
       should now be able to invoke any MySQL executable program by
       typing its name at the DOS prompt from any directory on the
       system, without having to supply the path. This includes the
       servers, the mysql client, and all MySQL command-line
       utilities such as mysqladmin and mysqldump.
       You should not add the MySQL bin directory to your Windows
       PATH if you are running multiple MySQL servers on the same
       machine.

   Warning

   You must exercise great care when editing your system PATH by
   hand; accidental deletion or modification of any portion of the
   existing PATH value can leave you with a malfunctioning or even
   unusable system.

   The following additional arguments can be used when installing the
   service:

     * You can specify a service name immediately following the
       --install option. The default service name is MySQL.

     * If a service name is given, it can be followed by a single
       option. By convention, this should be
       --defaults-file=file_name to specify the name of an option
       file from which the server should read options when it starts.
       The use of a single option other than --defaults-file is
       possible but discouraged. --defaults-file is more flexible
       because it enables you to specify multiple startup options for
       the server by placing them in the named option file.

     * You can also specify a --local-service option following the
       service name. This causes the server to run using the
       LocalService Windows account that has limited system
       privileges. This account is available only for Windows XP or
       newer. If both --defaults-file and --local-service are given
       following the service name, they can be in any order.

   For a MySQL server that is installed as a Windows service, the
   following rules determine the service name and option files that
   the server uses:

     * If the service-installation command specifies no service name
       or the default service name (MySQL) following the --install
       option, the server uses the a service name of MySQL and reads
       options from the [mysqld] group in the standard option files.

     * If the service-installation command specifies a service name
       other than MySQL following the --install option, the server
       uses that service name. It reads options from the [mysqld]
       group and the group that has the same name as the service in
       the standard option files. This enables you to use the
       [mysqld] group for options that should be used by all MySQL
       services, and an option group with the service name for use by
       the server installed with that service name.

     * If the service-installation command specifies a
       --defaults-file option after the service name, the server
       reads options the same way as described in the previous item,
       except that it reads options only from the the named file and
       ignores the standard option files.

   As a more complex example, consider the following command:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqld"
          --install MySQL --defaults-file=C:\my-opts.cnf

   Here, the default service name (MySQL) is given after the
   --install option. If no --defaults-file option had been given,
   this command would have the effect of causing the server to read
   the [mysqld] group from the standard option files. However,
   because the --defaults-file option is present, the server reads
   options from the [mysqld] option group, and only from the named
   file.
   Note

   On Windows, if the server is started with the --defaults-file and
   --install options, --install must be first. Otherwise, mysqld.exe
   will attempt to start the MySQL server.

   You can also specify options as Start parameters in the Windows
   Services utility before you start the MySQL service.

Starting the service

   Once a MySQL server has been installed as a service, Windows
   starts the service automatically whenever Windows starts. The
   service also can be started immediately from the Services utility,
   or by using a NET START MySQL command. The NET command is not case
   sensitive.

   When run as a service, mysqld has no access to a console window,
   so no messages can be seen there. If mysqld does not start, check
   the error log to see whether the server wrote any messages there
   to indicate the cause of the problem. The error log is located in
   the MySQL data directory (for example, C:\Program
   Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\data). It is the file with a suffix
   of .err.

   When a MySQL server has been installed as a service, and the
   service is running, Windows stops the service automatically when
   Windows shuts down. The server also can be stopped manually by
   using the Services utility, the NET STOP MySQL command, or the
   mysqladmin shutdown command.

   You also have the choice of installing the server as a manual
   service if you do not wish for the service to be started
   automatically during the boot process. To do this, use the
   --install-manual option rather than the --install option:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqld" --install-m
anual

Removing the service

   To remove a server that is installed as a service, first stop it
   if it is running by executing NET STOP MySQL. Then use the
   --remove option to remove it:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqld" --remove

   If mysqld is not running as a service, you can start it from the
   command line. For instructions, see Section 2.3.5.5, "Starting
   MySQL from the Windows Command Line."

   If you encounter difficulties during installation. see Section
   2.3.6, "Troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows MySQL Server
   Installation."

2.3.5.8 Testing The MySQL Installation

   You can test whether the MySQL server is working by executing any
   of the following commands:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqlshow"
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqlshow" -u root
mysql
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysqladmin" version
 status proc
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin\mysql" test

   If mysqld is slow to respond to TCP/IP connections from client
   programs, there is probably a problem with your DNS. In this case,
   start mysqld with the --skip-name-resolve option and use only
   localhost and IP addresses in the Host column of the MySQL grant
   tables.

   You can force a MySQL client to use a named-pipe connection rather
   than TCP/IP by specifying the --pipe or --protocol=PIPE option, or
   by specifying . (period) as the host name. Use the --socket option
   to specify the name of the pipe if you do not want to use the
   default pipe name.

   Note that if you have set a password for the root account, deleted
   the anonymous account, or created a new user account, then to
   connect to the MySQL server you must use the appropriate -u and -p
   options with the commands shown previously. See Section 4.2.2,
   "Connecting to the MySQL Server."

   For more information about mysqlshow, see Section 4.5.6,
   "mysqlshow --- Display Database, Table, and Column Information."

2.3.6 Troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows MySQL Server Installation

   When installing and running MySQL for the first time, you may
   encounter certain errors that prevent the MySQL server from
   starting. This section helps you diagnose and correct some of
   these errors.

   Your first resource when troubleshooting server issues is the
   error log. The MySQL server uses the error log to record
   information relevant to the error that prevents the server from
   starting. The error log is located in the data directory specified
   in your my.ini file. The default data directory location is
   C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\data, or
   C:\ProgramData\Mysql on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008. The
   C:\ProgramData directory is hidden by default. You need to change
   your folder options to see the directory and contents. For more
   information on the error log and understanding the content, see
   Section 5.2.2, "The Error Log."

   For information regarding possible errors, also consult the
   console messages displayed when the MySQL service is starting. Use
   the NET START MySQL command from the command line after installing
   mysqld as a service to see any error messages regarding the
   starting of the MySQL server as a service. See Section 2.3.5.7,
   "Starting MySQL as a Windows Service."

   The following examples show other common error messages you might
   encounter when installing MySQL and starting the server for the
   first time:

     * If the MySQL server cannot find the mysql privileges database
       or other critical files, it displays these messages:
System error 1067 has occurred.
Fatal error: Can't open and lock privilege tables:
Table 'mysql.user' doesn't exist
       These messages often occur when the MySQL base or data
       directories are installed in different locations than the
       default locations (C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6 and
       C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\data, respectively).
       This situation can occur when MySQL is upgraded and installed
       to a new location, but the configuration file is not updated
       to reflect the new location. In addition, old and new
       configuration files might conflict. Be sure to delete or
       rename any old configuration files when upgrading MySQL.
       If you have installed MySQL to a directory other than
       C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6, ensure that the MySQL
       server is aware of this through the use of a configuration
       (my.ini) file. Put the my.ini file in your Windows directory,
       typically C:\WINDOWS. To determine its exact location from the
       value of the WINDIR environment variable, issue the following
       command from the command prompt:
C:\> echo %WINDIR%
       You can create or modify an option file with any text editor,
       such as Notepad. For example, if MySQL is installed in
       E:\mysql and the data directory is D:\MySQLdata, you can
       create the option file and set up a [mysqld] section to
       specify values for the basedir and datadir options:
[mysqld]
# set basedir to your installation path
basedir=E:/mysql
# set datadir to the location of your data directory
datadir=D:/MySQLdata
       Note that Windows path names are specified in option files
       using (forward) slashes rather than backslashes. If you do use
       backslashes, double them:
[mysqld]
# set basedir to your installation path
basedir=C:\\Program Files\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 5.6
# set datadir to the location of your data directory
datadir=D:\\MySQLdata
       The rules for use of backslash in option file values are given
       in Section 4.2.3.3, "Using Option Files."
       If you change the datadir value in your MySQL configuration
       file, you must move the contents of the existing MySQL data
       directory before restarting the MySQL server.
       See Section 2.3.5.2, "Creating an Option File."

     * If you reinstall or upgrade MySQL without first stopping and
       removing the existing MySQL service and install MySQL using
       the MySQL Installer, you might see this error:
Error: Cannot create Windows service for MySql. Error: 0
       This occurs when the Configuration Wizard tries to install the
       service and finds an existing service with the same name.
       One solution to this problem is to choose a service name other
       than mysql when using the configuration wizard. This enables
       the new service to be installed correctly, but leaves the
       outdated service in place. Although this is harmless, it is
       best to remove old services that are no longer in use.
       To permanently remove the old mysql service, execute the
       following command as a user with administrative privileges, on
       the command line:
C:\> sc delete mysql
[SC] DeleteService SUCCESS
       If the sc utility is not available for your version of
       Windows, download the delsrv utility from
       http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/reskit/tools/exi
       sting/delsrv-o.asp and use the delsrv mysql syntax.

2.3.7 Upgrading MySQL on Windows

   To upgrade MySQL on Windows, follow these steps:

    1. Review Section 2.10.1, "Upgrading MySQL," for additional
       information on upgrading MySQL that is not specific to
       Windows.

    2. Always back up your current MySQL installation before
       performing an upgrade. See Section 7.2, "Database Backup
       Methods."

    3. Download the latest Windows distribution of MySQL from
       http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/.

    4. Before upgrading MySQL, stop the server. If the server is
       installed as a service, stop the service with the following
       command from the command prompt:
C:\> NET STOP MySQL
       If you are not running the MySQL server as a service, use
       mysqladmin to stop it. For example, before upgrading from
       MySQL 5.5 to 5.6, use mysqladmin from MySQL 5.5 as follows:
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\bin\mysqladmin" -u root
 shutdown
       Note
       If the MySQL root user account has a password, invoke
       mysqladmin with the -p option and enter the password when
       prompted.

    5. Before upgrading to MySQL 5.6 from a version previous to
       4.1.5, or from a version of MySQL installed from a Zip archive
       to a version of MySQL installed with the MySQL Installation
       Wizard, you must first manually remove the previous
       installation and MySQL service (if the server is installed as
       a service).
       To remove the MySQL service, use the following command:
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --remove
       If you do not remove the existing service, the MySQL
       Installation Wizard may fail to properly install the new MySQL
       service.

    6. If you are using the MySQL Installer, start it as described in
       Section 2.3.3, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using
       MySQL Installer."

    7. If you are upgrading MySQL from a Zip archive, extract the
       archive. You may either overwrite your existing MySQL
       installation (usually located at C:\mysql), or install it into
       a different directory, such as C:\mysql5. Overwriting the
       existing installation is recommended. However, for upgrades
       (as opposed to installing for the first time), you must remove
       the data directory from your existing MySQL installation to
       avoid replacing your current data files. To do so, follow
       these steps:
         a. Unzip the Zip archive in some location other than your
            current MySQL installation
         b. Remove the data directory
         c. Rezip the Zip archive
         d. Unzip the modified Zip archive on top of your existing
            installation
       Alternatively:
         a. Unzip the Zip archive in some location other than your
            current MySQL installation
         b. Remove the data directory
         c. Move the data directory from the current MySQL
            installation to the location of the just-removed data
            directory
         d. Remove the current MySQL installation
         e. Move the unzipped installation to the location of the
            just-removed installation

    8. If you were running MySQL as a Windows service and you had to
       remove the service earlier in this procedure, reinstall the
       service. (See Section 2.3.5.7, "Starting MySQL as a Windows
       Service.")

    9. Restart the server. For example, use NET START MySQL if you
       run MySQL as a service, or invoke mysqld directly otherwise.
   10. As Administrator, run mysql_upgrade to check your tables,
       attempt to repair them if necessary, and update your grant
       tables if they have changed so that you can take advantage of
       any new capabilities. See Section 4.4.7, "mysql_upgrade ---
       Check and Upgrade MySQL Tables."
   11. If you encounter errors, see Section 2.3.6, "Troubleshooting a
       Microsoft Windows MySQL Server Installation."

2.3.8 Windows Postinstallation Procedures

   GUI tools exist that perform most of the tasks described below,
   including:

     * MySQL Installer: Used to install and upgrade MySQL products.

     * MySQL Workbench: Manages the MySQL server and edits SQL
       queries.

     * MySQL Notifier: Starts, stops, or restarts the MySQL server,
       and monitors its status.

     * MySQL for Excel: Edits MySQL data with Microsoft Excel.

   On Windows, you need not create the data directory and the grant
   tables. MySQL Windows distributions include the grant tables with
   a set of preinitialized accounts in the mysql database under the
   data directory. Regarding passwords, if you installed MySQL using
   the MySQL Installer, you may have already assigned passwords to
   the accounts. (See Section 2.3.3, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft
   Windows Using MySQL Installer.") Otherwise, use the
   password-assignment procedure given in Section 2.9.2, "Securing
   the Initial MySQL Accounts."

   Before setting up passwords, you might want to try running some
   client programs to make sure that you can connect to the server
   and that it is operating properly. Make sure that the server is
   running (see Section 2.3.5.4, "Starting the Server for the First
   Time"), and then issue the following commands to verify that you
   can retrieve information from the server. You may need to specify
   directory different from C:\mysql\bin on the command line. If you
   used the MySQL Installer, the default directory is C:\Program
   Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6, and the mysql and mysqlshow client
   programs are in C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin. See
   Section 2.3.3, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using MySQL
   Installer," for more information.

   Use mysqlshow to see what databases exist:
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow
+--------------------+
|     Databases      |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| test               |
+--------------------+

   The list of installed databases may vary, but will always include
   the minimum of mysql and information_schema. In most cases, the
   test database will also be installed automatically.

   The preceding command (and commands for other MySQL programs such
   as mysql) may not work if the correct MySQL account does not
   exist. For example, the program may fail with an error, or you may
   not be able to view all databases. If you installed using MySQL
   Installer, then the root user will have been created automatically
   with the password you supplied. In this case, you should use the
   -u root and -p options. (You will also need to use the -u root and
   -p options if you have already secured the initial MySQL
   accounts.) With -p, you will be prompted for the root password.
   For example:
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow -u root -p
Enter password: (enter root password here)
+--------------------+
|     Databases      |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| test               |
+--------------------+

   If you specify a database name, mysqlshow displays a list of the
   tables within the database:
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow mysql
Database: mysql
+---------------------------+
|          Tables           |
+---------------------------+
| columns_priv              |
| db                        |
| event                     |
| func                      |
| help_category             |
| help_keyword              |
| help_relation             |
| help_topic                |
| host                      |
| plugin                    |
| proc                      |
| procs_priv                |
| servers                   |
| tables_priv               |
| time_zone                 |
| time_zone_leap_second     |
| time_zone_name            |
| time_zone_transition      |
| time_zone_transition_type |
| user                      |
+---------------------------+

   Use the mysql program to select information from a table in the
   mysql database:
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysql -e "SELECT Host,Db,User FROM mysql.db"
+------+--------+------+
| host | db     | user |
+------+--------+------+
| %    | test   |      |
| %    | test_% |      |
+------+--------+------+

   For more information about mysqlshow and mysql, see Section 4.5.6,
   "mysqlshow --- Display Database, Table, and Column Information,"
   and Section 4.5.1, "mysql --- The MySQL Command-Line Tool."

   If you are running a version of Windows that supports services,
   you can set up the MySQL server to run automatically when Windows
   starts. See Section 2.3.5.7, "Starting MySQL as a Windows
   Service."

2.4 Installing MySQL on Mac OS X

   MySQL for Mac OS X is available in a number of different forms:

     * Native Package Installer format, which uses the native Mac OS
       X installer to walk you through the installation of MySQL. For
       more information, see Section 2.4.2, "Installing MySQL on Mac
       OS X Using Native Packages." You can use the package installer
       with Mac OS X 10.3 and later, and the package is available for
       both PowerPC and Intel architectures, and 32-bit and 64-bit
       architectures. There is no Universal Binary available using
       the package installation method. The user you use to perform
       the installation must have administrator privileges.

     * Tar package format, which uses a file packaged using the Unix
       tar and gzip commands. To use this method, you will need to
       open a Terminal window. You do not need administrator
       privileges using this method, as you can install the MySQL
       server anywhere using this method. For more information on
       using this method, you can use the generic instructions for
       using a tarball, Section 2.2, "Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux
       Using Generic Binaries."You can use the package installer with
       Mac OS X 10.3 and later, and available for both PowerPC and
       Intel architectures, and both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
       A Universal Binary, incorporating both Power PC and Intel
       architectures and 32-bit and 64-bit binaries is available.
       In addition to the core installation, the Package Installer
       also includes Section 2.4.3, "Installing the MySQL Startup
       Item" and Section 2.4.4, "Installing and Using the MySQL
       Preference Pane," both of which simplify the management of
       your installation.

     * Mac OS X server includes a version of MySQL as standard. If
       you want to use a more recent version than that supplied with
       the Mac OS X server release, you can make use of the package
       or tar formats. For more information on using the MySQL
       bundled with Mac OS X, see Section 2.4.5, "Using the Bundled
       MySQL on Mac OS X Server."

   For additional information on using MySQL on Mac OS X, see Section
   2.4.1, "General Notes on Installing MySQL on Mac OS X."

2.4.1 General Notes on Installing MySQL on Mac OS X

   You should keep the following issues and notes in mind:

     * The default location for the MySQL Unix socket is different on
       Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server depending on the installation
       type you chose. The following table shows the default
       locations by installation type.
       Table 2.5 MySQL Unix Socket Locations on Mac OS X by
       Installation Type

               Installation Type             Socket Location
       Package Installer from MySQL       /tmp/mysql.sock
       Tarball from MySQL                 /tmp/mysql.sock
       MySQL Bundled with Mac OS X Server /var/mysql/mysql.sock
       To prevent issues, you should either change the configuration
       of the socket used within your application (for example,
       changing php.ini), or you should configure the socket location
       using a MySQL configuration file and the socket option. For
       more information, see Section 5.1.3, "Server Command Options."

     * You may need (or want) to create a specific mysql user to own
       the MySQL directory and data. On Mac OS X 10.4 and lower you
       can do this by using the Netinfo Manager application, located
       within the Utilities folder within the Applications folder. On
       Mac OS X 10.5 and later you can do this through the Directory
       Utility. From Mac OS X 10.5 and later (including Mac OS X
       Server 10.5) the mysql should already exist. For use in single
       user mode, an entry for _mysql (note the underscore prefix)
       should already exist within the system /etc/passwd file.

     * Due to a bug in the Mac OS X package installer, you may see
       this error message in the destination disk selection dialog:
You cannot install this software on this disk. (null)
       If this error occurs, click the Go Back button once to return
       to the previous screen. Then click Continue to advance to the
       destination disk selection again, and you should be able to
       choose the destination disk correctly. We have reported this
       bug to Apple and it is investigating this problem.

     * If you get an "insecure startup item disabled" error when
       MySQL launches, use the following procedure. Adjust the
       pathnames appropriately for your system.

         1. Modify the mysql.script using this command (enter it on a
            single line):
shell> sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit
  /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server

         2. Locate the option file that defines the basedir value and
            modify it to contain these lines:
basedir=/usr/local/mysql
datadir=/usr/local/mysql/data
            In the /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/ directory, make
            the following group ID changes from staff to wheel:
shell> sudo chgrp wheel MySQLCOM StartupParameters.plist

         3. Start the server from System Preferences or Terminal.app.

     * Because the MySQL package installer installs the MySQL
       contents into a version and platform specific directory, you
       can use this to upgrade and migrate your database between
       versions. You will need to either copy the data directory from
       the old version to the new version, or alternatively specify
       an alternative datadir value to set location of the data
       directory.

     * You might want to add aliases to your shell's resource file to
       make it easier to access commonly used programs such as mysql
       and mysqladmin from the command line. The syntax for bash is:
alias mysql=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
alias mysqladmin=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin
       For tcsh, use:
alias mysql /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
alias mysqladmin /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin
       Even better, add /usr/local/mysql/bin to your PATH environment
       variable. You can do this by modifying the appropriate startup
       file for your shell. For more information, see Section 4.2.1,
       "Invoking MySQL Programs."

     * After you have copied over the MySQL database files from the
       previous installation and have successfully started the new
       server, you should consider removing the old installation
       files to save disk space. Additionally, you should also remove
       older versions of the Package Receipt directories located in
       /Library/Receipts/mysql-VERSION.pkg.

2.4.2 Installing MySQL on Mac OS X Using Native Packages

   You can install MySQL on Mac OS X 10.3.x ("Panther") or newer
   using a Mac OS X binary package in DMG format instead of the
   binary tarball distribution. Please note that older versions of
   Mac OS X (for example, 10.1.x or 10.2.x) are not supported by this
   package.

   The package is located inside a disk image (.dmg) file that you
   first need to mount by double-clicking its icon in the Finder. It
   should then mount the image and display its contents.
   Note

   Before proceeding with the installation, be sure to stop all
   running MySQL server instances by using either the MySQL Manager
   Application (on Mac OS X Server) or mysqladmin shutdown on the
   command line.

   When installing from the package version, you should also install
   the MySQL Preference Pane, which will enable you to control the
   startup and execution of your MySQL server from System
   Preferences. For more information, see Section 2.4.4, "Installing
   and Using the MySQL Preference Pane."

   When installing using the package installer, the files are
   installed into a directory within /usr/local matching the name of
   the installation version and platform. For example, the installer
   file mysql-5.1.39-osx10.5-x86_64.pkg installs MySQL into
   /usr/local/mysql-5.1.39-osx10.5-x86_64 . The following table shows
   the layout of the installation directory.

   During the package installer process, a symbolic link from
   /usr/local/mysql to the version/platform specific directory
   created during installation will be created automatically.

    1. Download and open the MySQL package installer, which is
       provided on a disk image (.dmg) that includes the main MySQL
       installation package, the MySQLStartupItem.pkg installation
       package, and the MySQL.prefPane. Double-click the disk image
       to open it.

    2. Double-click the MySQL installer package. It will be named
       according to the version of MySQL you have downloaded. For
       example, if you have downloaded MySQL 5.1.39, double-click
       mysql-5.1.39-osx10.5-x86.pkg.

    3. You will be presented with the opening installer dialog. Click
       Continue to begin installation.

    5. If you have downloaded the community version of MySQL, you
       will be shown a copy of the relevant GNU General Public
       License. Click Continue .

    6. Select the drive you want to use to install the MySQL Startup
       Item. The drive must have a valid, bootable, Mac OS X
       operating system installed. Click Continue.
       MySQL Package Installer: Step 4

    7. You will be asked to confirm the details of the installation,
       including the space required for the installation. To change
       the drive on which the startup item is installed, click either
       Go Back or Change Install Location.... To install the startup
       item, click Install.

    8. Once the installation has been completed successfully, you
       will be shown an Install Succeeded message.

   For convenience, you may also want to install the startup item and
   preference pane. See Section 2.4.3, "Installing the MySQL Startup
   Item," and Section 2.4.4, "Installing and Using the MySQL
   Preference Pane."

2.4.3 Installing the MySQL Startup Item

   The MySQL Installation Package includes a startup item that can be
   used to automatically start and stop MySQL.

   To install the MySQL Startup Item:

    1. Download and open the MySQL package installer, which is
       provided on a disk image (.dmg) that includes the main MySQL
       installation package, the MySQLStartupItem.pkg installation
       package, and the MySQL.prefPane. Double-click the disk image
       to open it.

    2. Double-click the MySQLStartItem.pkg file to start the
       installation process.

    3. You will be presented with the Install MySQL Startup Item
       dialog.
       MySQL Startup Item Installer: Step 1
       Click Continue to continue the installation process.

    4. A copy of the installation instructions and other important
       information relevant to this installation are displayed. Click
       Continue .

    5. Select the drive you want to use to install the MySQL Startup
       Item. The drive must have a valid, bootable, Mac OS X
       operating system installed. Click Continue.
       MySQL Startup Item Installer: Step 3

    6. You will be asked to confirm the details of the installation.
       To change the drive on which the startup item is installed,
       click either Go Back or Change Install Location.... To install
       the startup item, click Install.

    7. Once the installation has been completed successfully, you
       will be shown an Install Succeeded message.
       MySQL Startup Item Installer: Step 5

   The Startup Item for MySQL is installed into
   /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM. The Startup Item installation adds
   a variable MYSQLCOM=-YES- to the system configuration file
   /etc/hostconfig. If you want to disable the automatic startup of
   MySQL, change this variable to MYSQLCOM=-NO-.

   After the installation, you can start and stop MySQL by running
   the following commands in a terminal window. You must have
   administrator privileges to perform these tasks, and you may be
   prompted for your password.

   If you have installed the Startup Item, use this command to start
   the server:
shell> sudo /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MySQLCOM start

   If you have installed the Startup Item, use this command to stop
   the server:
shell> sudo /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MySQLCOM stop

2.4.4 Installing and Using the MySQL Preference Pane

   The MySQL Package installer disk image also includes a custom
   MySQL Preference Pane that enables you to start, stop, and control
   automated startup during boot of your MySQL installation.

   To install the MySQL Preference Pane:

    1. Download and open the MySQL package installer package, which
       is provided on a disk image (.dmg) that includes the main
       MySQL installation package, the MySQLStartupItem.pkg
       installation package, and the MySQL.prefPane. Double-click the
       disk image to open it.

    2. Double-click the MySQL.prefPane. The MySQL System Preferences
       will open.

    3. If this is the first time you have installed the preference
       pane, you will be asked to confirm installation and whether
       you want to install the preference pane for all users, or only
       the current user. To install the preference pane for all users
       you will need administrator privileges. If necessary, you will
       be prompted for the username and password for a user with
       administrator privileges.

    4. If you already have the MySQL Preference Pane installed, you
       will be asked to confirm whether you want to overwrite the
       existing MySQL Preference Pane.

   Note

   The MySQL Preference Pane only starts and stops MySQL installation
   installed from the MySQL package installation that have been
   installed in the default location.

   Once the MySQL Preference Pane has been installed, you can control
   your MySQL server instance using the preference pane. To use the
   preference pane, open the System Preferences... from the Apple
   menu. Select the MySQL preference pane by clicking the MySQL logo
   within the Other section of the preference panes list.
   MySQL Preference Pane

   The MySQL Preference Pane shows the current status of the MySQL
   server, showing stopped (in red) if the server is not running and
   running (in green) if the server has already been started. The
   preference pane also shows the current setting for whether the
   MySQL server has been set to start automatically.

     * To start MySQL using the preference pane: 
       Click Start MySQL Server. You may be prompted for the username
       and password of a user with administrator privileges to start
       the MySQL server.

     * To stop MySQL using the preference pane: 
       Click Stop MySQL Server. You may be prompted for the username
       and password of a user with administrator privileges to stop
       the MySQL server.

     * To automatically start the MySQL server when the system boots:
       Check the check box next to Automatically Start MySQL Server
       on Startup.

     * To disable automatic MySQL server startup when the system
       boots:
       Uncheck the check box next to Automatically Start MySQL Server
       on Startup.

   You can close the System Preferences... window once you have
   completed your settings.

2.4.5 Using the Bundled MySQL on Mac OS X Server

   If you are running Mac OS X Server, a version of MySQL should
   already be installed. The following table shows the versions of
   MySQL that ship with Mac OS X Server versions.

   Table 2.7 MySQL Versions Preinstalled with Mac OS X Server
   Mac OS X Server Version MySQL Version
   10.2-10.2.2             3.23.51

       (http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/WebTech_v10.6.pdf).

     * The MySQL server bundled with Mac OS X Server does not include
       the MySQL client libraries and header files required to access
       and use MySQL from a third-party driver, such as Perl DBI or
       PHP. For more information on obtaining and installing MySQL
       libraries, see Mac OS X Server version 10.5: MySQL libraries
       available for download (http://support.apple.com/kb/TA25017).
       Alternatively, you can ignore the bundled MySQL server and
       install MySQL from the package or tarball installation.

2.5 Installing MySQL on Linux

   Linux supports a number of different solutions for installing
   MySQL. We recommend that you use one of the distributions from
   Oracle, for which several methods for installation are available:

     * Installing from a generic binary package in .tar.gz format.
       See Section 2.2, "Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic
       Binaries" for more information.

     * Extracting and compiling MySQL from a source distribution. For
       detailed instructions, see Section 2.8, "Installing MySQL from
       Source."

     * Installing with Yum using the MySQL Yum repository
       (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/). For detailed
       instructions, see Section 2.5.1, "Installing MySQL on Linux
       Using the MySQL Yum Repository."

     * Installing using a precompiled RPM package. For more
       information, see Section 2.5.3, "Installing MySQL on Linux
       Using RPM Packages."

     * Installing using a precompiled Debian package. For more
       information, see Section 2.5.4, "Installing MySQL on Linux
       Using Debian Packages."

   As an alternative, you can use the package manager on your system
   to automatically download and install MySQL with packages from the
   native software repositories of your Linux distribution. These
   native package are often several versions behind the currently
   available release. You will also normally be unable to install
   development milestone releases (DMRs), as these are not usually
   made available in the native repositories. For more information on
   using the native package installers, see Section 2.5.5,
   "Installing MySQL on Linux Using Native Package Managers."
   Note

   For many Linux installations, you will want to set up MySQL to be
   started automatically when your machine starts. Many of the native
   package installations perform this operation for you, but for
   source, binary and RPM solutions you may need to set this up
   separately. The required script, mysql.server, can be found in the
   support-files directory under the MySQL installation directory or
   in a MySQL source tree. You can install it as /etc/init.d/mysql
   for automatic MySQL startup and shutdown. See Section 2.9.1.2,
   "Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically."

2.5.1 Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL Yum Repository

   MySQL provides a Yum-style software repository for the following
   Linux platforms:

     * EL5, EL6, and EL7-based platforms (for example, the relevant
       versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Linux, and
       CentOS)

     * Fedora 19 and 20

   Currently, the MySQL Yum repository
   (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/) for the above-mentioned
   platforms provides RPM packages for installing the MySQL server,
   client, MySQL Workbench, MySQL Utilities (not available for
   EL5-based platforms), Connector/ODBC, and Connector/Python (not
   available for EL5-based platforms).

   MySQL does not currently provide software repositories for other
   Linux platforms. Refer to Section 2.5, "Installing MySQL on Linux"
   for instructions on how to install MySQL on those platforms.
   Note

   The MySQL Yum repository service is now in development release. We
   encourage you to try it and provide us with feedback. Please
   report any bugs or inconsistencies you observe to our Bugs
   Database (http://bugs.mysql.com).

Before You Start

   As a popular, open-source software, MySQL, in its original or
   re-packaged form, is widely installed on many systems from various
   sources, including different software download sites, software
   repositories, and so on. The following instructions assume that no
   versions of MySQL (whether distributed by Oracle or other parties)
   have already been installed on your system; if that is not the
   case, see Section 2.10.1.1, "Upgrading MySQL with the MySQL Yum
   Repository" or Section 2.5.2, "Replacing a Third-Party
   Distribution of MySQL Using the MySQL Yum Repository."

Steps for a Fresh Installation of the latest GA Version of MySQL

   Follow the steps below to install the latest GA version of MySQL
   with the MySQL Yum repository:

    1. Adding the MySQL Yum Repository
       First, add the MySQL Yum repository to your system's
       repository list. This is a one-time operation, which can be
       performed by installing an RPM provided by MySQL. Follow these
       steps:
         a. Go to the Download MySQL Yum Repository page
            (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo) in the MySQL
            Developer Zone.
         b. Select and download the release package for your
            platform.
         c. Install the downloaded release package with the following
            command (except for EL5-based systems), replacing
            platform-and-version-specific with the name of the
            downloaded RPM file:
shell> sudo yum localinstall platform-and-version-specific.rpm
            For an EL6-based system, the command is in the form of:
shell> sudo yum localinstall mysql-community-release-el6-{version-num
ber}.noarch.rpm
            For an EL7-based system:
shell> sudo yum localinstall mysql-community-release-el7-{version-num
ber}.noarch.rpm
            For Fedora 19:
shell> sudo yum localinstall mysql-community-release-fc19-{version-nu
mber}.noarch.rpm
            For Fedora 20:
shell> sudo yum localinstall mysql-community-release-fc20-{version-nu
mber}.noarch.rpm
            For an EL5-based system, use the following command
            instead:
shell> sudo rpm -Uvh mysql-community-release-el5-{version-number}.noa
rch.rpm
            The installation command adds the MySQL Yum repository to
            your system's repository list and downloads the GnuPG key
            to check the integrity of the software packages. See
            Section 2.1.4.2, "Signature Checking Using GnuPG" for
            details on GnuPG key checking.
            You can check that the MySQL Yum repository has been
            successfully added by the following command:
shell> sudo yum repolist enabled | grep "mysql*-community*"
       Note
       Once the MySQL Yum repository is enabled on your system, any
       system-wide update by the yum update command will upgrade
       MySQL packages on your system and also replace any native
       third-party packages, if Yum finds replacements for them from
       within the MySQL Yum repository; see Section 2.10.1.1,
       "Upgrading MySQL with the MySQL Yum Repository" and, for a
       discussion on some possible effects of that on your system,
       see Section 2.10.1.1, "."

    2. Installing MySQL with Yum
       Install MySQL by the following command:
shell> sudo yum install mysql-server
       This installs the package for MySQL server
       (mysql-community-server) and also packages for the components
       required to run the server, including packages for the client
       (mysql-community-client), the common error messages and
       character sets for client and server (mysql-community-common),
       and the shared client libraries (mysql-community-libs).

    3. Starting and Stopping the MySQL Server
       Start the MySQL server with the following command:
shell> sudo service mysqld start
       This is a sample output of the above command:
Starting mysqld:[ OK ]
       You can check the status of the MySQL server with the
       following command:
shell> sudo service mysqld status
       This is a sample output of the above command:
mysqld (pid 3066) is running.
       Stop the MySQL server with the following command:
shell> sudo service mysqld stop

    4. Securing the MySQL Installation
       Always run the program mysql_secure_installation to secure
       your MySQL installation:
shell> mysql_secure_installation
       mysql_secure_installation allows you to perform important
       operations like setting root password, removing anonymous
       users, and so on. The program is safe and easy to use. It is
       important to remember the root password you set though. See
       Section 4.4.5, "mysql_secure_installation --- Improve MySQL
       Installation Security" for details.

   For more information on the postinstallation procedures, see
   Section 2.9, "Postinstallation Setup and Testing."

Installing Additional MySQL Products and Components with Yum

   You can use Yum to install and manage individual components of
   MySQL. Some of these components are hosted in sub-repositories of
   the MySQL Yum repository: for example, the MySQL Connectors are to
   be found in the MySQL Connectors Community sub-repository, and the
   MySQL Workbench in MySQL Tools Community. You can use the
   following command to list the packages for all the MySQL
   components available for your platform from the MySQL Yum
   repository:
shell> sudo yum --disablerepo=\* --enablerepo='mysql*-community*' lis
t available

   Install any packages of your choice with the following command,
   replacing package-name with name of the package:
shell> sudo yum install package-name

   For example, to install MySQL Workbench:
shell> sudo yum install mysql-workbench-community

   To install the shared client libraries:
shell> sudo yum install mysql-community-libs

Steps for a Fresh Installation of a Developer Milestone Release (DMR)
of MySQL

   Follow the steps below to install a developer milestone release
   (DMR) of MySQL with the MySQL Yum repository:
   Warning

   Developer milestone releases (DMRs) are for use at your own risk.
   Significant development changes take place in milestone releases
   and you may encounter compatibility issues, such as data format
   changes that require attention in addition to the usual procedure
   of running mysql_upgrade. For example, you may find it necessary
   to dump your data with mysqldump before the upgrade and reload it
   afterward.


    1. Add the MySQL Yum repository by following the instructions
       given in Section 2.5.1, "."

    2. Enable and disable the appropriate sub-repositories. Inside
       the MySQL Yum repositories, different release series of the
       MySQL Community Server are hosted in different
       sub-repositories. Sub-repository for the latest GA series
       (currently 5.6) is enabled by default, and sub-repositories
       for all other series (for example, the 5.7 series, currently
       still in developer milestone release (DMR) status) are
       disabled by default. Use this command to see all the
       sub-repositories in the MySQL Yum repository:
shell> sudo yum repolist all | grep "mysql*-community*"
       To install the latest release from a specific series other
       than the latest GA series, simply disable the sub-repository
       for the latest GA series and enable the sub-repository for the
       specific series before running the yum install command. This
       is how it can be done, if, for example, you want to install
       the 5.7 DMR series:
shell> sudo yum-config-manager --disable mysql56-community
shell> sudo yum-config-manager --enable mysql57-community-dmr
       You can also enable and disable sub-repositories by editing
       manually the /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql-community.repo file. This
       is a typical entry for a sub-repository in the file:
# Enable to use MySQL 5.6
[mysql56-community]
name=MySQL 5.6 Community Server
baseurl=//repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.6-community/el/5/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql
       Find the entry for the sub-repository you want to configure,
       and edit the enabled= line. Make enabled=0 to disable a
       sub-repository, or enabled=1 to enable a sub-repository.
       You can verify that the enabling and disabling of
       sub-repositories have been done correctly by run the following
       command and check its output:
shell> sudo yum repolist enabled | grep "mysql*-community*"
       Note
       You can only enable sub-repository for one release series at a
       time. When sub-repositories for more than one release series
       are enabled, the latest series will be used by Yum.
       Then, install the MySQL server from the chosen series by the
       command:
shell> sudo yum install mysql-server

    3. Follow the instructions given in Section 2.5.1, "" and Section
       2.5.1, "."

Updating MySQL with Yum

   Besides installation, you can also perform updates for MySQL
   products and components using the MySQL Yum repository. See
   Section 2.10.1.1, "Upgrading MySQL with the MySQL Yum Repository"
   for details.

2.5.2 Replacing a Third-Party Distribution of MySQL Using the MySQL
Yum Repository

   Different distributions of MySQL are distributed by different
   parties through their own software repositories or download sites.
   You can replace a third-party distribution of MySQL using the
   MySQL Yum repository in a few steps.

    1. Backing Up Your Database
       To avoid loss of data, always back up your database before
       trying to replace your MySQL installation using the MySQL Yum
       repository. See Chapter 7, "Backup and Recovery" on how to
       back up your database.

    2. Stopping Yum from Receiving MySQL Packages from Third-Party,
       Non-Native Repositories
       Before you can use the MySQL Yum repository for installing (or
       updating) MySQL, you must stop your system from receiving
       MySQL packages from any third-party, non-native Yum
       repositories.
       One way to check whether Yum is now receiving third-party
       MySQL distributions from other repositories is to use the
       following command:
shell> yum list installed mysql\*
       This is a sample output for the command:
mysql.i686              5.1.69-1.el6_4      @updates
mysql-libs.i686         5.1.69-1.el6_4      @updates
mysql-server.i686       5.1.69-1.el6_4      @updates
       The output shows the names of the packages of the third-party
       MySQL distribution that are installed and, on the right-hand
       side, the repository (which is named updates, a native
       repository for the Linux distribution) from which they were
       installed.
       However, sometimes the names of the packages of the
       third-party distribution might not contain the string "mysql"
       in it. It might be useful to search also with this command:
shell> yum --disablerepo=\* provides mysql\*
       The following is a sample output of the command:
MariaDB-compat-10.0.4-1.i686 ...
...
Repo        : installed
Matched from:
Other       : mysql-libs



MariaDB-server-10.0.4-1.i686 ...
...
Repo        : installed
Matched from:
Other       : mysql-server
       From the result we can see the names of some of the packages
       for the installed third-party distribution of MySQL
       (MariaDB-server and MariaDB-compat). To try to get an
       exhaustive list of packages installed for this third-party
       distribution of MySQL, it might be helpful to search for
       installed packages of similar names with, for example, the
       following command:
shell> yum list installed mariadb\*
       This is a sample output for the command:
MariaDB-common.i686                      10.0.4-1
   @mariadb
MariaDB-compat.i686                      10.0.4-1
   @mariadb
MariaDB-server.i686                      10.0.4-1
   @mariadb
       From the command output, we can identify all the installed
       packages (MariaDB-common, MariaDB-compat, and MariaDB-server)
       and the third-party Yum repository from which they were
       installed (named mariadb).
       The next step is to stop Yum from receiving packages from the
       third-party Yum repository:
shell> sudo yum-config-manager --disable mariadb
       Note
       For platforms like Fedora 19 and 20 that install MySQL from
       the native repositories, this step is usually not required,
       unless you have explicitly added a third-party Yum repository
       for MySQL packages.

    3. Adding the MySQL Yum Repository
       Once the third-party Yum repository has been disabled, add the
       MySQL Yum repository to your system's repository list by
       following the instructions given in Section 2.5.1, "."

    4. Uninstalling the Third-Party MySQL Distribution and Installing
       MySQL with the MySQL Yum Repository
       The installed third-party MySQL distribution must first be
       uninstalled before you can use the MySQL Yum repository to
       install MySQL, or the installation process will give an error.
       Assuming that, as in the example above, the third-part MySQL
       packages you have found are named MariaDB-common,
       MariaDB-compat, and MariaDB-server, uninstall them with the
       following command:
shell> sudo yum remove MariaDB-common MariaDB-compat MariaDB-server
       Note
       If your third-party MySQL distribution was not installed by
       Yum or by an RPM installer, you will not be able to detect and
       then uninstall it by Yum. If you are not sure what to do in
       that case, consult a system administrator or the original
       third-party distributor.
       Then, install MySQL from the MySQL Yum repository with the
       following command:
shell> sudo yum install mysql-server
       The MySQL server and other components required to run the
       server, including the client, the shared client libraries, and
       the common error messages and character sets for client and
       server, are now installed from the MySQL Yum repository. To
       install more components for MySQL, see Section 2.5.1, "."
       Follow the postinstallation procedures exdocbuild-run-cmd
       push-docs-to-web-staging.sh downloadsplained in Section 2.9,
       "Postinstallation Setup and Testing."

2.5.3 Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages

   Note

   To install or upgrade to MySQL 5.6.11, be sure to read the special
   instructions at the end of this section.

   The recommended way to install MySQL on RPM-based Linux
   distributions that use glibc is by using the RPM packages provided
   by MySQL. There are two methods for doing so: for EL5, EL6, or
   EL7-based platforms and Fedora 19 or 20, this can be done using
   the MySQL Yum repository (see Section 2.5.1, "Installing MySQL on
   Linux Using the MySQL Yum Repository" for details); for other
   platforms, we provide various RPM packages that work for different
   platforms, and this section explains how these packages work.

   For non-RPM Linux distributions, you can install MySQL using a
   .tar.gz package. See Section 2.2, "Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux
   Using Generic Binaries."

   Installations created from our Linux RPM distributions result in
   files under the system directories shown in the following table.

   Table 2.9 MySQL Installation Layout for Linux RPM Packages
   Directory Contents of Directory
   /usr/bin Client programs and scripts
   /usr/sbin The mysqld server
   /var/lib/mysql Log files, databases
   /usr/share/info Manual in Info format
   /usr/share/man Unix manual pages
   /usr/include/mysql Include (header) files
   /usr/lib/mysql Libraries
   /usr/share/mysql Miscellaneous support files, including error
   messages, character set files, sample configuration files, SQL for
   database installation
   /usr/share/sql-bench Benchmarks
   Note

   RPM distributions of MySQL are also provided by other vendors. Be
   aware that they may differ from those built by us in features,
   capabilities, and conventions (including communication setup), and
   that the instructions in this manual do not necessarily apply to
   installing them. The vendor's instructions should be consulted
   instead. Because of these differences, RPM packages built by us
   check whether such RPMs built by other vendors are installed. If
   so, the RPM does not install and produces a message explaining
   this.

   Conflicts can arise when an RPM from another vendor is already
   installed, such as when a vendor's convention about which files
   belong with the server and which belong with the client library
   differ from the breakdown used for Oracle packages. In such cases,
   attempts to install an Oracle RPM with rpm -i may result in
   messages that files in the RPM to be installed conflict with files
   from an installed package (denoted mysql-libs in the following
   paragraphs).

   We provide a MySQL-shared-compat package with each MySQL release.
   This package is meant to replace mysql-libs and provides a
   replacement-compatible client library for older MySQL series.
   MySQL-shared-compat is set up to make mysql-libs obsolete, but rpm
   explicitly refuses to replace obsoleted packages when invoked with
   -i (unlike -U), which is why installation with rpm -i produces a
   conflict.

   MySQL-shared-compat can safely be installed alongside mysql-libs
   because libraries are installed to different locations. Therefore,
   it is possible to install shared-compat first, then manually
   remove mysql-libs before continuing with the installation. After
   mysql-libs is removed, the dynamic linker stops looking for the
   client library in the location where mysql-libs puts it, and the
   library provided by the MySQL-shared-compat package takes over.

   Another alternative is to install packages using yum. In a
   directory containing all RPM packages for a MySQL release, yum
   install MySQL*rpm installs them in the correct order and removes
   mysql-libs in one step without conflicts.

   In most cases, you need to install only the MySQL-server and
   MySQL-client packages to get a functional MySQL installation. The
   other packages are not required for a standard installation.

   As of MySQL 5.6.8, new RPM install operations (not upgrades)
   invoke mysql_install_db with the --random-passwords option that
   provides for more secure MySQL installation. Invoking
   mysql_install_db with --random-passwords causes it to assign a
   random password to the MySQL root accounts, set the "password
   expired" flag for those accounts, and not create anonymous-user
   MySQL accounts. It will be necessary after installation to start
   the server, connect as root using the password written to the
   $HOME/.mysql_secret file, and assign a new root password. Until
   this is done, root cannot do anything else. This must be done for
   each root account you intend to use. To change the password, you
   can use the SET PASSWORD statement (for example, with the mysql
   client). You can also use mysqladmin or mysql_secure_installation.
   For additional details, see Section 4.4.3, "mysql_install_db ---
   Initialize MySQL Data Directory." (Install operations using RPMs
   for Unbreakable Linux Network are unaffected because they do not
   use mysql_install_db.)

   RPMs for MySQL Cluster.  Standard MySQL server RPMs built by MySQL
   do not provide support for the NDBCLUSTER storage engine.
   Important

   When upgrading a MySQL Cluster RPM installation, you must upgrade
   all installed RPMs, including the Server and Client RPMs.

   For more information about installing MySQL Cluster from RPMs, see
   Section 17.2, "MySQL Cluster Installation."

   For upgrades, if your installation was originally produced by
   installing multiple RPM packages, it is best to upgrade all the
   packages, not just some. For example, if you previously installed
   the server and client RPMs, do not upgrade just the server RPM.

   If the data directory exists at RPM installation time, the
   installation process does not modify existing data. This has the
   effect, for example, that accounts in the grant tables are not
   initialized to the default set of accounts.

   If you get a dependency failure when trying to install MySQL
   packages (for example, error: removing these packages would break
   dependencies: libmysqlclient.so.10 is needed by ...), you should
   also install the MySQL-shared-compat package, which includes the
   shared libraries for older releases for backward compatibility.

   The RPM packages shown in the following list are available. The
   names shown here use a suffix of .linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm, but
   particular packages can have different suffixes, described later.

     * MySQL-server-VERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm
       The MySQL server. You need this unless you only want to
       connect to a MySQL server running on another machine.

     * MySQL-client-VERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm
       The standard MySQL client programs. You probably always want
       to install this package.

     * MySQL-devel-VERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm
       The libraries and include files that are needed if to compile
       other MySQL clients, such as the Perl modules. Install this
       RPM if you intend to compile C API applications.

     * MySQL-shared-VERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm
       This package contains the shared libraries
       (libmysqlclient.so*) that certain languages and applications
       need to dynamically load and use MySQL. It contains
       single-threaded and thread-safe libraries. Install this RPM if
       you intend to compile or run C API applications that depend on
       the shared client library.

     * MySQL-shared-compat-VERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm
       This package includes the shared libraries for older releases,
       but not the libraries for the current release. It contains
       single-threaded and thread-safe libraries. Install this
       package if you have applications installed that are
       dynamically linked against older versions of MySQL but you
       want to upgrade to the current version without breaking the
       library dependencies.
       As of MySQL 5.6.5, the MySQL-shared-compat RPM package enables
       users of Red Hat-provided mysql-*-5.1 RPM packages to migrate
       to Oracle-provided MySQL-*-5.5 packages. MySQL-shared-compat
       replaces the Red Hat mysql-libs package by replacing
       libmysqlclient.so files of the latter package, thus satisfying
       dependencies of other packages on mysql-libs. This change
       affects only users of Red Hat (or Red Hat-compatible) RPM
       packages. Nothing is different for users of Oracle RPM
       packages.

     * MySQL-embedded-VERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm
       The embedded MySQL server library.

     * MySQL-test-VERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm
       This package includes the MySQL test suite.

     * MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm
       This contains the source code for all of the previous
       packages. It can also be used to rebuild the RPMs on other
       architectures (for example, Alpha or SPARC).

   The suffix of RPM package names (following the VERSION value) has
   the following syntax:
.PLATFORM.CPU.rpm

   The PLATFORM and CPU values indicate the type of system for which
   the package is built. PLATFORM indicates the platform and CPU
   indicates the processor type or family.

   All packages are dynamically linked against glibc 2.5. The
   PLATFORM value indicates whether the package is platform
   independent or intended for a specific platform, as shown in the
   following table.

   Table 2.10 MySQL Linux Installation Packages
   PLATFORM Value Intended Use
   linux_glibc25 Platform independent, should run on any Linux
   distribution that supports glibc 2.5
   rhel5, rhel6 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or 6
   el6 Enterprise Linux 6
   sles10, sles11 SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 or 11

   In MySQL 5.6, only linux_glibc2.5 packages are available
   currently.

   The CPU value indicates the processor type or family for which the
   package is built.

   Table 2.11 MySQL Installation Packages for Linux CPU Identifiers
      CPU Value      Intended Processor Type or Family
   i386, i586, i686 Pentium processor or better, 32 bit
   x86_64           64-bit x86 processor
   ia64             Itanium (IA-64) processor

   To see all files in an RPM package (for example, a MySQL-server
   RPM), run a command like this:
shell> rpm -qpl MySQL-server-VERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm

   To perform a standard minimal installation, install the server and
   client RPMs:
shell> rpm -i MySQL-server-VERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm
shell> rpm -i MySQL-client-VERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm

   To install only the client programs, install just the client RPM:
shell> rpm -i MySQL-client-VERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm

   RPM provides a feature to verify the integrity and authenticity of
   packages before installing them. To learn more about this feature,
   see Section 2.1.4, "Verifying Package Integrity Using MD5
   Checksums or GnuPG."

   The server RPM places data under the /var/lib/mysql directory. The
   RPM also creates a login account for a user named mysql (if one
   does not exist) to use for running the MySQL server, and creates
   the appropriate entries in /etc/init.d/ to start the server
   automatically at boot time. (This means that if you have performed
   a previous installation and have made changes to its startup
   script, you may want to make a copy of the script so that you do
   not lose it when you install a newer RPM.) See Section 2.9.1.2,
   "Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically," for more information
   on how MySQL can be started automatically on system startup.

   In MySQL 5.6, during a new installation, the server boot scripts
   are installed, but the MySQL server is not started at the end of
   the installation, since the status of the server during an
   unattended installation is not known.

   In MySQL 5.6, during an upgrade installation using the RPM
   packages, if the MySQL server is running when the upgrade occurs,
   the MySQL server is stopped, the upgrade occurs, and the MySQL
   server is restarted. If the MySQL server is not already running
   when the RPM upgrade occurs, the MySQL server is not started at
   the end of the installation.

   If something goes wrong, you can find more information in the
   binary installation section. See Section 2.2, "Installing MySQL on
   Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries."
   Note

   The accounts that are listed in the MySQL grant tables initially
   have no passwords. After starting the server, you should set up
   passwords for them using the instructions in Section 2.9,
   "Postinstallation Setup and Testing."

   During RPM installation, a user named mysql and a group named
   mysql are created on the system. This is done using the useradd,
   groupadd, and usermod commands. Those commands require appropriate
   administrative privileges, which is required for locally managed
   users and groups (as listed in the /etc/passwd and /etc/group
   files) by the RPM installation process being run by root.

   If you log in as the mysql user, you may find that MySQL displays
   "Invalid (old?) table or database name" errors that mention
   .mysqlgui, lost+found, .mysqlgui, .bash_history, .fonts.cache-1,
   .lesshst, .mysql_history, .profile, .viminfo, and similar files
   created by MySQL or operating system utilities. You can safely
   ignore these error messages or remove the files or directories
   that cause them if you do not need them.

   For nonlocal user management (LDAP, NIS, and so forth), the
   administrative tools may require additional authentication (such
   as a password), and will fail if the installing user does not
   provide this authentication. Even if they fail, the RPM
   installation will not abort but succeed, and this is intentional.
   If they failed, some of the intended transfer of ownership may be
   missing, and it is recommended that the system administrator then
   manually ensures some appropriate user and group exists and
   manually transfers ownership following the actions in the RPM spec
   file.

   In MySQL 5.6.11, the RPM spec file has been updated, which has the
   following consequences:

     * For a non-upgrade installation (no existing MySQL version
       installed), it possible to install MySQL using yum.

     * For upgrades, it is necessary to clean up any earlier MySQL
       installations. In effect, the update is performed by removing
       the old installations and installing the new one.

   Additional details follow.

   For a non-upgrade installation of MySQL 5.6.11, it is possible to
   install using yum:
shell> yum install MySQL-server-NEWVERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm

   For upgrades to MySQL 5.6.11, the upgrade is performed by removing
   the old installation and installing the new one. To do this, use
   the following procedure:

    1. Remove the existing 5.6.X installation. OLDVERSION is the
       version to remove.
shell> rpm -e MySQL-server-OLDVERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm
       Repeat this step for all installed MySQL RPMs.

    2. Install the new version. NEWVERSION is the version to install.
shell> rpm -ivh MySQL-server-NEWVERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm

   Alternatively, the removal and installation can be done using yum:
shell> yum remove MySQL-server-OLDVERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm
shell> yum install MySQL-server-NEWVERSION.linux_glibc2.5.i386.rpm

2.5.4 Installing MySQL on Linux Using Debian Packages

   Oracle provides Debian packages for installation on Debian or
   Debian-like Linux systems. To obtain a package, see Section 2.1.3,
   "How to Get MySQL."
   Note

   Debian distributions of MySQL are also provided by other vendors.
   Be aware that they may differ from those built by us in features,
   capabilities, and conventions (including communication setup), and
   that the instructions in this manual do not necessarily apply to
   installing them. The vendor's instructions should be consulted
   instead.

   Debian package files have names in mysql-MVER-DVER-CPU.deb format.
   MVER is the MySQL version and DVER is the Debian version. The CPU
   value indicates the processor type or family for which the package
   is built, as shown in the following table.

   Table 2.12 MySQL Installation Packages for Linux CPU Identifiers
   CPU Value  Intended Processor Type or Family
   i686      Pentium processor or better, 32 bit
   x86_64    64-bit x86 processor

   After downloading a Debian package, use the following command to
   install it;
shell> dpkg -i mysql-MVER-DVER-CPU.deb

   The Debian package installs files in the /opt/mysql/server-5.6
   directory.

   You may also need to install the libaio library if it is not
   already present on your system:
shell> apt-get install libaio1

2.5.5 Installing MySQL on Linux Using Native Package Managers

   Many Linux distributions include a version of the MySQL server,
   client tools, and development components in their standard package
   management system. This section provides basic instructions for
   installing MySQL using those package management systems.
   Important

   Native package are often several versions behind the currently
   available release. You will also normally be unable to install
   development milestone releases (DMRs), as these are not usually
   made available in the native repositories. Before proceeding, we
   recommend that you check out the other installation options
   described in Section 2.5, "Installing MySQL on Linux."

   Distribution specific instructions are shown below:

     * Red Hat Linux, Fedora, CentOS
       Note
       For EL5, EL6, or EL7-based Linux platforms and Fedora 19 or
       20, you can install MySQL using the MySQL Yum repository. See
       Section 2.5.1, "Installing MySQL on Linux Using the MySQL Yum
       Repository" for details.
       For Red Hat and similar distributions, the MySQL distribution
       is divided into a number of separate packages, mysql for the
       client tools, mysql-server for the server and associated
       tools, and mysql-libs for the libraries. The libraries are
       required if you want to provide connectivity from different
       languages and environments such as Perl, Python and others.
       To install, use the yum command to specify the packages that
       you want to install. For example:
root-shell> yum install mysql mysql-server mysql-libs mysql-server
Loaded plugins: presto, refresh-packagekit

Complete!
       MySQL and the MySQL server should now be installed. A sample
       configuration file is installed into /etc/my.cnf. An init
       script, to start and stop the server, will have been installed
       into /etc/init.d/mysqld. To start the MySQL server use
       service:
root-shell> service mysqld start
       To enable the server to be started and stopped automatically
       during boot, use chkconfig:
root-shell> chkconfig --levels 235 mysqld on
       Which enables the MySQL server to be started (and stopped)
       automatically at the specified the run levels.
       The database tables will have been automatically created for
       you, if they do not already exist. You should, however, run
       mysql_secure_installation to set the root passwords on your
       server.

     * Debian, Ubuntu, Kubuntu
       On Debian and related distributions, there are two packages,
       mysql-client and mysql-server, for the client and server
       components respectively. You should specify an explicit
       version, for example mysql-client-5.1, to ensure that you
       install the version of MySQL that you want.
       To download and install, including any dependencies, use the
       apt-get command, specifying the packages that you want to
       install.
       Note
       Before installing, make sure that you update your apt-get
       index files to ensure you are downloading the latest available
       version.
       A sample installation of the MySQL packages might look like
       this (some sections trimmed for clarity):
root-shell> apt-get install mysql-client-5.1 mysql-server-5.1

       Note
       The apt-get command will install a number of packages,
       including the MySQL server, in order to provide the typical
       tools and application environment. This can mean that you
       install a large number of packages in addition to the main
       MySQL package.
       During installation, the initial database will be created, and
       you will be prompted for the MySQL root password (and
       confirmation). A configuration file will have been created in
       /etc/mysql/my.cnf. An init script will have been created in
       /etc/init.d/mysql.
       The server will already be started. You can manually start and
       stop the server using:
root-shell> service mysql [start|stop]
       The service will automatically be added to the 2, 3 and 4 run
       levels, with stop scripts in the single, shutdown and restart
       levels.

     * Gentoo Linux
       As a source-based distribution, installing MySQL on Gentoo
       involves downloading the source, patching the Gentoo
       specifics, and then compiling the MySQL server and installing
       it. This process is handled automatically by the emerge
       command. Depending on the version of MySQL that you want to
       install, you may need to unmask the specific version that you
       want for your chosen platform.
       The MySQL server and client tools are provided within a single
       package, dev-db/mysql. You can obtain a list of the versions
       available to install by looking at the portage directory for
       the package:
root-shell> ls /usr/portage/dev-db/mysql/mysql-5.1*
mysql-5.1.39-r1.ebuild
mysql-5.1.44-r1.ebuild
mysql-5.1.44-r2.ebuild
mysql-5.1.44-r3.ebuild
mysql-5.1.44.ebuild
mysql-5.1.45-r1.ebuild
mysql-5.1.45.ebuild
mysql-5.1.46.ebuild
       To install a specific MySQL version, you must specify the
       entire atom. For example:
root-shell> emerge =dev-db/mysql-5.1.46
       A simpler alternative is to use the virtual/mysql-5.1 package,
       which will install the latest version:
root-shell> emerge =virtual/mysql-5.1
       If the package is masked (because it is not tested or
       certified for the current platform), use the ACCEPT_KEYWORDS
       environment variable. For example:
root-shell> ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge =virtual/mysql-5.1
       After installation, you should create a new database using
       mysql_install_db, and set the password for the root user on
       MySQL. You can use the configuration interface to set the
       password and create the initial database:
root-shell> emerge --config =dev-db/mysql-5.1.46
       A sample configuration file will have been created for you in
       /etc/mysql/my.cnf, and an init script will have been created
       in /etc/init.d/mysql.
       To enable MySQL to start automatically at the normal (default)
       run levels, you can use:
root-shell> rc-update add mysql default

2.6 Installing MySQL on Solaris and OpenSolaris

   MySQL on Solaris and OpenSolaris is available in a number of
   different formats.

     * For information on installing using the native Solaris PKG
       format, see Section 2.6.1, "Installing MySQL on Solaris Using
       a Solaris PKG."

     * On OpenSolaris, the standard package repositories include
       MySQL packages specially built for OpenSolaris that include
       entries for the Service Management Framework (SMF) to enable
       control of the installation using the SMF administration
       commands. For more information, see Section 2.6.2, "Installing
       MySQL on OpenSolaris Using IPS."

     * To use a standard tar binary installation, use the notes
       provided in Section 2.2, "Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using
       Generic Binaries." Check the notes and hints at the end of
       this section for Solaris specific notes that you may need
       before or after installation.

   To obtain a binary MySQL distribution for Solaris in tarball or
   PKG format, http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.6.html.

   Additional notes to be aware of when installing and using MySQL on
   Solaris:

     * If you want to use MySQL with the mysql user and group, use
       the groupadd and useradd commands:
groupadd mysql
useradd -g mysql mysql

     * If you install MySQL using a binary tarball distribution on
       Solaris, you may run into trouble even before you get the
       MySQL distribution unpacked, as the Solaris tar cannot handle
       long file names. This means that you may see errors when you
       try to unpack MySQL.
       If this occurs, you must use GNU tar (gtar) to unpack the
       distribution. In Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris gtar is normally
       located in /usr/sfw/bin/gtar, but may not be included in the
       default path definition.

     * When using Solaris 10 for x86_64, you should mount any file
       systems on which you intend to store InnoDB files with the
       forcedirectio option. (By default mounting is done without
       this option.) Failing to do so will cause a significant drop
       in performance when using the InnoDB storage engine on this
       platform.

     * If you would like MySQL to start automatically, you can copy
       support-files/mysql.server to /etc/init.d and create a
       symbolic link to it named /etc/rc3.d/S99mysql.server.

     * If too many processes try to connect very rapidly to mysqld,
       you should see this error in the MySQL log:
Error in accept: Protocol error
       You might try starting the server with the --back_log=50
       option as a workaround for this.

     * To configure the generation of core files on Solaris you
       should use the coreadm command. Because of the security
       implications of generating a core on a setuid() application,
       by default, Solaris does not support core files on setuid()
       programs. However, you can modify this behavior using coreadm.
       If you enable setuid() core files for the current user, they
       will be generated using the mode 600 and owned by the
       superuser.

2.6.1 Installing MySQL on Solaris Using a Solaris PKG

   You can install MySQL on Solaris and OpenSolaris using a binary
   package using the native Solaris PKG format instead of the binary
   tarball distribution.

   To use this package, download the corresponding
   mysql-VERSION-solaris10-PLATFORM.pkg.gz file, then uncompress it.
   For example:
shell> gunzip mysql-5.6.18-solaris10-x86_64.pkg.gz

   To install a new package, use pkgadd and follow the onscreen
   prompts. You must have root privileges to perform this operation:
shell> pkgadd -d mysql-5.6.18-solaris10-x86_64.pkg

The following packages are available:
  1  mysql     MySQL Community Server (GPL)
               (i86pc) 5.6.18

Select package(s) you wish to process (or 'all' to process
all packages). (default: all) [?,??,q]:

   The PKG installer installs all of the files and tools needed, and
   then initializes your database if one does not exist. To complete
   the installation, you should set the root password for MySQL as
   provided in the instructions at the end of the installation.
   Alternatively, you can run the mysql_secure_installation script
   that comes with the installation.

   By default, the PKG package installs MySQL under the root path
   /opt/mysql. You can change only the installation root path when
   using pkgadd, which can be used to install MySQL in a different
   Solaris zone. If you need to install in a specific directory, use
   a binary tar file distribution.

   The pkg installer copies a suitable startup script for MySQL into
   /etc/init.d/mysql. To enable MySQL to startup and shutdown
   automatically, you should create a link between this file and the
   init script directories. For example, to ensure safe startup and
   shutdown of MySQL you could use the following commands to add the
   right links:
shell> ln /etc/init.d/mysql /etc/rc3.d/S91mysql
shell> ln /etc/init.d/mysql /etc/rc0.d/K02mysql

   To remove MySQL, the installed package name is mysql. You can use
   this in combination with the pkgrm command to remove the
   installation.

   To upgrade when using the Solaris package file format, you must
   remove the existing installation before installing the updated
   package. Removal of the package does not delete the existing
   database information, only the server, binaries and support files.
   The typical upgrade sequence is therefore:
shell> mysqladmin shutdown
shell> pkgrm mysql
shell> pkgadd -d mysql-5.6.18-solaris10-x86_64.pkg
shell> mysqld_safe &
shell> mysql_upgrade

   You should check the notes in Section 2.10, "Upgrading or
   Downgrading MySQL" before performing any upgrade.

2.6.2 Installing MySQL on OpenSolaris Using IPS

   OpenSolaris includes standard packages for MySQL in the core
   repository. The MySQL packages are based on a specific release of
   MySQL and updated periodically. For the latest release you must
   use either the native Solaris PKG, tar, or source installations.
   The native OpenSolaris packages include SMF files so that you can
   easily control your MySQL installation, including automatic
   startup and recovery, using the native service management tools.

   To install MySQL on OpenSolaris, use the pkg command. You will
   need to be logged in as root, or use the pfexec tool, as shown in
   the example below:
shell> pfexec pkg install SUNWmysql56

   The package set installs three individual packages,
   SUNWmysql56lib, which contains the MySQL client libraries;
   SUNWmysql56r which contains the root components, including SMF and
   configuration files; and SUNWmysql56u which contains the scripts,
   binary tools and other files. You can install these packages
   individually if you only need the corresponding components.

   The MySQL files are installed into /usr/mysql which symbolic links
   for the sub directories (bin, lib, etc.) to a version specific
   directory. For MySQL 5.6, the full installation is located in
   /usr/mysql/5.6. The default data directory is /var/mysql/5.6/data.
   The configuration file is installed in /etc/mysql/5.6/my.cnf. This
   layout permits multiple versions of MySQL to be installed, without
   overwriting the data and binaries from other versions.

   Once installed, you must run mysql_install_db to initialize the
   database, and use the mysql_secure_installation to secure your
   installation.

Using SMF to manage your MySQL installation

   Once installed, you can start and stop your MySQL server using the
   installed SMF configuration. The service name is mysql, or if you
   have multiple versions installed, you should use the full version
   name, for example mysql:version_56. To start and enable MySQL to
   be started at boot time:
shell> svcadm enable mysql

   To disable MySQL from starting during boot time, and shut the
   MySQL server down if it is running, use:
shell> svcadm disable mysql

   To restart MySQL, for example after a configuration file changes,
   use the restart option:
shell> svcadm restart mysql

   You can also use SMF to configure the data directory and enable
   full 64-bit mode. For example, to set the data directory used by
   MySQL:
shell> svccfg 
svc:> select mysql:version_56 
svc:/application/database/mysql:version_56> setprop mysql/data=/data0
/mysql


   By default, the 32-bit binaries are used. To enable the 64-bit
   server on 64-bit platforms, set the enable_64bit parameter. For
   example:
svc:/application/database/mysql:version_56> setprop mysql/enable_64bi
t=1

   You need to refresh the SMF after settings these options:
shell> svcadm refresh mysql

2.7 Installing MySQL on FreeBSD

   This section provides information about installing MySQL on
   variants of FreeBSD Unix.

   You can install MySQL on FreeBSD by using the binary distribution
   provided by Oracle. For more information, see Section 2.2,
   "Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries."

   The easiest (and preferred) way to install MySQL is to use the
   mysql-server and mysql-client ports available at
   http://www.freebsd.org/. Using these ports gives you the following
   benefits:

     * A working MySQL with all optimizations enabled that are known
       to work on your version of FreeBSD.

     * Automatic configuration and build.

     * Startup scripts installed in /usr/local/etc/rc.d.

     * The ability to use pkg_info -L to see which files are
       installed.

     * The ability to use pkg_delete to remove MySQL if you no longer
       want it on your machine.

   The MySQL build process requires GNU make (gmake) to work. If GNU
   make is not available, you must install it first before compiling
   MySQL.

   To install using the ports system:
# cd /usr/ports/databases/mysql51-server
# make
...
# cd /usr/ports/databases/mysql51-client
# make
...

   The standard port installation places the server into
   /usr/local/libexec/mysqld, with the startup script for the MySQL
   server placed in /usr/local/etc/rc.d/mysql-server.

   Some additional notes on the BSD implementation:

     * To remove MySQL after installation using the ports system:
# cd /usr/ports/databases/mysql51-server
# make deinstall
...
# cd /usr/ports/databases/mysql51-client
# make deinstall
...

     * If you get problems with the current date in MySQL, setting
       the TZ variable should help. See Section 2.11, "Environment
       Variables."

2.8 Installing MySQL from Source

   Building MySQL from the source code enables you to customize build
   parameters, compiler optimizations, and installation location. For
   a list of systems on which MySQL is known to run, see
   http://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html.

   Before you proceed with an installation from source, check whether
   Oracle produces a precompiled binary distribution for your
   platform and whether it works for you. We put a great deal of
   effort into ensuring that our binaries are built with the best
   possible options for optimal performance. Instructions for
   installing binary distributions are available in Section 2.2,
   "Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries."

Source Installation Methods

   There are two methods for installing MySQL from source:

     * Use a standard MySQL source distribution. To obtain a standard
       distribution, see Section 2.1.3, "How to Get MySQL." For
       instructions on building from a standard distribution, see
       Section 2.8.2, "Installing MySQL Using a Standard Source
       Distribution."
       Standard distributions are available as compressed tar files,
       Zip archives, or RPM packages. Distribution files have names
       of the form mysql-VERSION.tar.gz, mysql-VERSION.zip, or
       mysql-VERSION.rpm, where VERSION is a number like 5.6.18. File
       names for source distributions can be distinguished from those
       for precompiled binary distributions in that source
       distribution names are generic and include no platform name,
       whereas binary distribution names include a platform name
       indicating the type of system for which the distribution is
       intended (for example, pc-linux-i686 or winx64).

     * Use a MySQL development tree. Development trees have not
       necessarily received the same level of testing as standard
       release distributions, so this installation method is usually
       required only if you need the most recent code changes. For
       information on building from one of the development trees, see
       Section 2.8.3, "Installing MySQL Using a Development Source
       Tree."

Source Installation System Requirements

   Installation of MySQL from source requires several development
   tools. Some of these tools are needed no matter whether you use a
   standard source distribution or a development source tree. Other
   tool requirements depend on which installation method you use.

   To install MySQL from source, your system must have the following
   tools, regardless of installation method:

     * CMake, which is used as the build framework on all platforms.
       CMake can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org.

     * A good make program. Although some platforms come with their
       own make implementations, it is highly recommended that you
       use GNU make 3.75 or newer. It may already be available on
       your system as gmake. GNU make is available from
       http://www.gnu.org/software/make/.

     * A working ANSI C++ compiler. GCC 4.2.1 or later, Sun Studio 10
       or later, Visual Studio 2010 or later, and many current
       vendor-supplied compilers are known to work.

     * Perl is needed if you intend to run test scripts. Most
       Unix-like systems include Perl. On Windows, you can use a
       version such as ActiveState Perl.

   To install MySQL from a standard source distribution, one of the
   following tools is required to unpack the distribution file:

     * For a .tar.gz compressed tar file: GNU gunzip to uncompress
       the distribution and a reasonable tar to unpack it. If your
       tar program supports the z option, it can both uncompress and
       unpack the file.
       GNU tar is known to work. The standard tar provided with some
       operating systems is not able to unpack the long file names in
       the MySQL distribution. You should download and install GNU
       tar, or if available, use a preinstalled version of GNU tar.
       Usually this is available as gnutar, gtar, or as tar within a
       GNU or Free Software directory, such as /usr/sfw/bin or
       /usr/local/bin. GNU tar is available from
       http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/.

     * For a .zip Zip archive: WinZip or another tool that can read
       .zip files.

     * For an .rpm RPM package: The rpmbuild program used to build
       the distribution unpacks it.

   To install MySQL from a development source tree, the following
   additional tools are required:

     * To obtain the source tree, you must have Bazaar installed. The
       Bazaar VCS Web site (http://bazaar-vcs.org) has instructions
       for downloading and installing Bazaar on different platforms.
       Bazaar is supported on any platform that supports Python, and
       is therefore compatible with any Linux, Unix, Windows, or Mac
       OS X host.

     * bison is needed to generate sql_yacc.cc from sql_yacc.yy You
       should use the latest version of bison where possible.
       Versions 1.75 and 2.1 are known to work. There have been
       reported problems with bison 1.875. If you experience
       problems, upgrade to a later, rather than earlier, version.
       bison is available from http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/.
       bison for Windows can be downloaded from
       http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm. Download
       the package labeled "Complete package, excluding sources". On
       Windows, the default location for bison is the C:\Program
       Files\GnuWin32 directory. Some utilities may fail to find
       bison because of the space in the directory name. Also, Visual
       Studio may simply hang if there are spaces in the path. You
       can resolve these problems by installing into a directory that
       does not contain a space; for example C:\GnuWin32.

     * On OpenSolaris and Solaris Express, m4 must be installed in
       addition to bison. m4 is available from
       http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/.

   Note

   If you have to install any programs, modify your PATH environment
   variable to include any directories in which the programs are
   located. See Section 4.2.4, "Setting Environment Variables."

   If you run into problems and need to file a bug report, please use
   the instructions in Section 1.7, "How to Report Bugs or Problems."

2.8.1 MySQL Layout for Source Installation

   By default, when you install MySQL after compiling it from source,
   the installation step installs files under /usr/local/mysql. The
   component locations under the installation directory are the same
   as for binary distributions. See Section 2.2, "MySQL Installation
   Layout for Generic Unix/Linux Binary Package," and Section 2.3.1,
   "MySQL Installation Layout on Microsoft Windows." To configure
   installation locations different from the defaults, use the
   options described at Section 2.8.4, "MySQL Source-Configuration
   Options."

2.8.2 Installing MySQL Using a Standard Source Distribution

   To install MySQL from a standard source distribution:

    1. Verify that your system satisfies the tool requirements listed
       at Section 2.8, "Installing MySQL from Source."

    2. Obtain a distribution file using the instructions in Section
       2.1.3, "How to Get MySQL."

    3. Configure, build, and install the distribution using the
       instructions in this section.

    4. Perform postinstallation procedures using the instructions in
       Section 2.9, "Postinstallation Setup and Testing."

   In MySQL 5.6, CMake is used as the build framework on all
   platforms. The instructions given here should enable you to
   produce a working installation. For additional information on
   using CMake to build MySQL, see How to Build MySQL Server with
   CMake (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/cmake.html).

   If you start from a source RPM, use the following command to make
   a binary RPM that you can install. If you do not have rpmbuild,
   use rpm instead.
shell> rpmbuild --rebuild --clean MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm

   The result is one or more binary RPM packages that you install as
   indicated in Section 2.5.3, "Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM
   Packages."

   The sequence for installation from a compressed tar file or Zip
   archive source distribution is similar to the process for
   installing from a generic binary distribution (see Section 2.2,
   "Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries"), except
   that it is used on all platforms and includes steps to configure
   and compile the distribution. For example, with a compressed tar
   file source distribution on Unix, the basic installation command
   sequence looks like this:
# Preconfiguration setup
shell> groupadd mysql
shell> useradd -r -g mysql mysql
# Beginning of source-build specific instructions
shell> tar zxvf mysql-VERSION.tar.gz
shell> cd mysql-VERSION
shell> cmake .
shell> make
shell> make install
# End of source-build specific instructions
# Postinstallation setup
shell> cd /usr/local/mysql
shell> chown -R mysql .
shell> chgrp -R mysql .
shell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
shell> chown -R root .
shell> chown -R mysql data
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
# Next command is optional
shell> cp support-files/mysql.server /etc/init.d/mysql.server

   mysql_install_db creates a default option file named my.cnf in the
   base installation directory. This file is created from a template
   included in the distribution package named my-default.cnf. For
   more information, see Section 5.1.2.2, "Using a Sample Default
   Server Configuration File."

   A more detailed version of the source-build specific instructions
   is shown following.
   Note

   The procedure shown here does not set up any passwords for MySQL
   accounts. After following the procedure, proceed to Section 2.9,
   "Postinstallation Setup and Testing," for postinstallation setup
   and testing.

Perform Preconfiguration Setup

   On Unix, set up the mysql user and group that will be used to run
   and execute the MySQL server and own the database directory. For
   details, see Creating a mysql System User and Group, in Section
   2.2, "Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries." Then
   perform the following steps as the mysql user, except as noted.

Obtain and Unpack the Distribution

   Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the distribution
   and change location into it.

   Obtain a distribution file using the instructions in Section
   2.1.3, "How to Get MySQL."

   Unpack the distribution into the current directory:

     * To unpack a compressed tar file, tar can uncompress and unpack
       the distribution if it has z option support:
shell> tar zxvf mysql-VERSION.tar.gz
       If your tar does not have z option support, use gunzip to
       unpack the distribution and tar to unpack it:
shell> gunzip < mysql-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
       Alternatively, CMake can uncompress and unpack the
       distribution:
shell> cmake -E tar zxvf mysql-VERSION.tar.gz

     * To unpack a Zip archive, use WinZip or another tool that can
       read .zip files.

   Unpacking the distribution file creates a directory named
   mysql-VERSION.

Configure the Distribution

   Change location into the top-level directory of the unpacked
   distribution:
shell> cd mysql-VERSION

   Configure the source directory. The minimum configuration command
   includes no options to override configuration defaults:
shell> cmake .

   On Windows, specify the development environment. For example, the
   following commands configure MySQL for 32-bit or 64-bit builds,
   respectively:
shell> cmake . -G "Visual Studio 10 2010"
shell> cmake . -G "Visual Studio 10 2010 Win64"

   On Mac OS X, to use the Xcode IDE:
shell> cmake . -G Xcode

   When you run cmake, you might want to add options to the command
   line. Here are some examples:

     * -DBUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release: Configure the source with the
       same build options used by Oracle to produce binary
       distributions for official MySQL releases.

     * -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=dir_name: Configure the distribution
       for installation under a particular location.

     * -DCPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL=1: Cause make package to generate a
       single installation file rather than multiple files.

     * -DWITH_DEBUG=1: Build the distribution with debugging support.

   For a more extensive list of options, see Section 2.8.4, "MySQL
   Source-Configuration Options."

   To list the configuration options, use one of the following
   commands:
shell> cmake . -L   # overview
shell> cmake . -LH  # overview with help text
shell> cmake . -LAH # all params with help text
shell> ccmake .     # interactive display

   If CMake fails, you might need to reconfigure by running it again
   with different options. If you do reconfigure, take note of the
   following:

     * If CMake is run after it has previously been run, it may use
       information that was gathered during its previous invocation.
       This information is stored in CMakeCache.txt. When CMake
       starts up, it looks for that file and reads its contents if it
       exists, on the assumption that the information is still
       correct. That assumption is invalid when you reconfigure.

     * Each time you run CMake, you must run make again to recompile.
       However, you may want to remove old object files from previous
       builds first because they were compiled using different
       configuration options.

   To prevent old object files or configuration information from
   being used, run these commands on Unix before re-running CMake:
shell> make clean
shell> rm CMakeCache.txt

   Or, on Windows:
shell> devenv MySQL.sln /clean
shell> del CMakeCache.txt

   If you build out of the source tree (as described later), the
   CMakeCache.txt file and all built files are in the build
   directory, so you can remove that directory to object files and
   cached configuration information.

   If you are going to send mail to a MySQL mailing list to ask for
   configuration assistance, first check the files in the CMakeFiles
   directory for useful information about the failure. To file a bug
   report, please use the instructions in Section 1.7, "How to Report
   Bugs or Problems."

Build the Distribution

   On Unix:
shell> make
shell> make VERBOSE=1

   The second command sets VERBOSE to show the commands for each
   compiled source.

   Use gmake instead on systems where you are using GNU make and it
   has been installed as gmake.

   On Windows:
shell> devenv MySQL.sln /build RelWithDebInfo

   It is possible to build out of the source tree to keep the tree
   clean. If the top-level source directory is named mysql-src under
   your current working directory, you can build in a directory named
   bld at the same level like this:
shell> mkdir bld
shell> cd bld
shell> cmake ../mysql-src

   The build directory need not actually be outside the source tree.
   For example, to build in a directory directory, you can build in a
   directory named bld under the top-level source tree, do this,
   starting with mysql-src as your current working directory:
shell> mkdir bld
shell> cd bld
shell> cmake ..

   If you have multiple source trees at the same level (for example,
   to build multiple versions of MySQL), the second strategy can be
   advantageous. The first strategy places all build directories at
   the same level, which requires that you choose a unique name for
   each. With the second strategy, you can use the same name for the
   build directory within each source tree.

   If you have gotten to the compilation stage, but the distribution
   does not build, see Section 2.8.5, "Dealing with Problems
   Compiling MySQL," for help. If that does not solve the problem,
   please enter it into our bugs database using the instructions
   given in Section 1.7, "How to Report Bugs or Problems." If you
   have installed the latest versions of the required tools, and they
   crash trying to process our configuration files, please report
   that also. However, if you get a command not found error or a
   similar problem for required tools, do not report it. Instead,
   make sure that all the required tools are installed and that your
   PATH variable is set correctly so that your shell can find them.

Install the Distribution

   On Unix:
shell> make install

   This installs the files under the configured installation
   directory (by default, /usr/local/mysql). You might need to run
   the command as root.

   To install in a specific directory, add a DESTDIR parameter to the
   command line:
shell> make install DESTDIR="/opt/mysql"

   Alternatively, generate installation package files that you can
   install where you like:
shell> make package

   This operation produces one or more .tar.gz files that can be
   installed like generic binary distribution packages. See Section
   2.2, "Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries." If
   you run CMake with -DCPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL=1, the operation
   produces a single file. Otherwise, it produces multiple files.

   On Windows, generate the data directory, then create a .zip
   archive installation package:
shell> devenv MySQL.sln /build RelWithDebInfo /project initial_databa
se
shell> devenv MySQL.sln /build RelWithDebInfo /project package

   You can install the resulting .zip archive where you like. See
   Section 2.3.5, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using a
   noinstall Zip Archive."

Perform Postinstallation Setup

   The remainder of the installation process involves setting up the
   configuration file, creating the core databases, and starting the
   MySQL server. For instructions, see Section 2.9, "Postinstallation
   Setup and Testing."
   Note

   The accounts that are listed in the MySQL grant tables initially
   have no passwords. After starting the server, you should set up
   passwords for them using the instructions in Section 2.9,
   "Postinstallation Setup and Testing."

2.8.3 Installing MySQL Using a Development Source Tree

   This section discusses how to install MySQL from the latest
   development source code. Development trees have not necessarily
   received the same level of testing as standard release
   distributions, so this installation method is usually required
   only if you need the most recent code changes. Do not use a
   development tree for production systems. If your goal is simply to
   get MySQL up and running on your system, you should use a standard
   release distribution (either a binary or source distribution). See
   Section 2.1.3, "How to Get MySQL."

   MySQL development projects are hosted on Launchpad
   (http://launchpad.net/). MySQL projects, including MySQL Server,
   MySQL Workbench, and others are available from the Oracle/MySQL
   Engineering (http://launchpad.net/~mysql) page. For the
   repositories related only to MySQL Server, see the MySQL Server
   (http://launchpad.net/mysql-server) page.

   To install MySQL from a development source tree, your system must
   satisfy the tool requirements listed at Section 2.8, "Installing
   MySQL from Source," including the requirements for Bazaar and
   bison.

   To create a local branch of the MySQL development tree on your
   machine, use this procedure:

    1. To obtain a copy of the MySQL source code, you must create a
       new Bazaar branch. If you do not already have a Bazaar
       repository directory set up, you must initialize a new
       directory:
shell> mkdir mysql-server
shell> bzr init-repo --trees mysql-server
       This is a one-time operation.

    2. Assuming that you have an initialized repository directory,
       you can branch from the public MySQL server repositories to
       create a local source tree. To create a branch of a specific
       version:
shell> cd mysql-server
shell> bzr branch lp:mysql-server/5.6 mysql-5.6
       This is a one-time operation per source tree. You can branch
       the source trees for several versions of MySQL under the
       mysql-server directory.

    3. The initial download will take some time to complete,
       depending on the speed of your connection. Please be patient.
       Once you have downloaded the first tree, additional trees
       should take significantly less time to download.

    4. When building from the Bazaar branch, you may want to create a
       copy of your active branch so that you can make configuration
       and other changes without affecting the original branch
       contents. You can achieve this by branching from the original
       branch:
shell> bzr branch mysql-5.6 mysql-5.6-build

    5. To obtain changes made after you have set up the branch
       initially, update it using the pull option periodically. Use
       this command in the top-level directory of the local copy:
shell> bzr pull
       To examine the changeset comments for the tree, use the log
       option to bzr:
shell> bzr log
       You can also browse changesets, comments, and source code
       online at the Launchpad MySQL Server
       (http://launchpad.net/mysql-server) page.
       If you see diffs (changes) or code that you have a question
       about, do not hesitate to send email to the MySQL internals
       mailing list. See Section 1.6.1, "MySQL Mailing Lists." If you
       think you have a better idea on how to do something, send an
       email message to the list with a patch.

   After you have the local branch, you can build MySQL server from
   the source code. For information, see Section 2.8.2, "Installing
   MySQL Using a Standard Source Distribution," except that you skip
   the part about obtaining and unpacking the distribution.

   Be careful about installing a build from a distribution source
   tree on a production machine. The installation command may
   overwrite your live release installation. If you already have
   MySQL installed and do not want to overwrite it, run CMake with
   values for the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, MYSQL_TCP_PORT, and
   MYSQL_UNIX_ADDR options different from those used by your
   production server. For additional information about preventing
   multiple servers from interfering with each other, see Section
   5.3, "Running Multiple MySQL Instances on One Machine."

   Play hard with your new installation. For example, try to make new
   features crash. Start by running make test. See Section 23.1.2,
   "The MySQL Test Suite."

2.8.4 MySQL Source-Configuration Options

   The CMake program provides a great deal of control over how you
   configure a MySQL source distribution. Typically, you do this
   using options on the CMake command line. For information about
   options supported by CMake, run either of these commands in the
   top-level source directory:
shell> cmake . -LH
shell> ccmake .

   You can also affect CMake using certain environment variables. See
   Section 2.11, "Environment Variables."

   The following table shows the available CMake options. In the
   Default column, PREFIX stands for the value of the
   CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option, which specifies the installation base
   directory. This value is used as the parent location for several
   of the installation subdirectories.

   Table 2.13 MySQL Source-Configuration Option Reference (CMake)

     * Section 2.8.4, ""

     * Section 2.8.4, ""

     * Section 2.8.4, ""

     * Section 2.8.4, ""

     * Section 2.8.4, ""

   For boolean options, the value may be specified as 1 or ON to
   enable the option, or as 0 or OFF to disable the option.

   Many options configure compile-time defaults that can be
   overridden at server startup. For example, the
   CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, MYSQL_TCP_PORT, and MYSQL_UNIX_ADDR options
   that configure the default installation base directory location,
   TCP/IP port number, and Unix socket file can be changed at server
   startup with the --basedir, --port, and --socket options for
   mysqld. Where applicable, configuration option descriptions
   indicate the corresponding mysqld startup option.

General Options


     * -DBUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release
       This option configures a source distribution with the same
       build options used by Oracle to produce binary distributions
       for official MySQL releases.

     * -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=type
       The type of build to produce:

          + RelWithDebInfo: Enable optimizations and generate
            debugging information. This is the default MySQL build
            type.

          + Debug: Disable optimizations and generate debugging
            information. This build type is also used if the
            WITH_DEBUG option is enabled. That is, -DWITH_DEBUG=1 has
            the same effect as -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug.

     * -DCPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL=bool
       This option affects whether the make package operation
       produces multiple installation package files or a single file.
       If disabled, the operation produces multiple installation
       package files, which may be useful if you want to install only
       a subset of a full MySQL installation. If enabled, it produces
       a single file for installing everything.

Installation Layout Options

   The CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option indicates the base installation
   directory. Other options with names of the form INSTALL_xxx that
   indicate component locations are interpreted relative to the
   prefix and their values are relative pathnames. Their values
   should not include the prefix.

     * -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=dir_name
       The installation base directory.
       This value can be set at server startup with the --basedir
       option.

     * -DINSTALL_BINDIR=dir_name
       Where to install user programs.

     * -DINSTALL_DOCDIR=dir_name
       Where to install documentation.

     * -DINSTALL_DOCREADMEDIR=dir_name
       Where to install README files.

     * -DINSTALL_INCLUDEDIR=dir_name
       Where to install header files.

     * -DINSTALL_INFODIR=dir_name
       Where to install Info files.

     * -DINSTALL_LAYOUT=name
       Select a predefined installation layout:

          + STANDALONE: Same layout as used for .tar.gz and .zip
            packages. This is the default.

          + RPM: Layout similar to RPM packages.

          + SVR4: Solaris package layout.

          + DEB: DEB package layout (experimental).
       You can select a predefined layout but modify individual
       component installation locations by specifying other options.
       For example:
shell> cmake . -DINSTALL_LAYOUT=SVR4 -DMYSQL_DATADIR=/var/mysql/data

     * -DINSTALL_LIBDIR=dir_name
       Where to install library files.

     * -DINSTALL_MANDIR=dir_name
       Where to install manual pages.

     * -DINSTALL_MYSQLSHAREDIR=dir_name
       Where to install shared data files.

     * -DINSTALL_MYSQLTESTDIR=dir_name
       Where to install the mysql-test directory. As of MySQL 5.6.12,
       to suppress installation of this directory, explicitly set the
       option to the empty value (-DINSTALL_MYSQLTESTDIR=).

     * -DINSTALL_PLUGINDIR=dir_name
       The location of the plugin directory.
       This value can be set at server startup with the --plugin_dir
       option.

     * -DINSTALL_SBINDIR=dir_name
       Where to install the mysqld server.

     * -DINSTALL_SCRIPTDIR=dir_name
       Where to install mysql_install_db.

     * -DINSTALL_SHAREDIR=dir_name
       Where to install aclocal/mysql.m4.

     * -DINSTALL_SQLBENCHDIR=dir_name
       Where to install the sql-bench directory. To suppress
       installation of this directory, explicitly set the option to
       the empty value (-DINSTALL_SQLBENCHDIR=).

     * -DINSTALL_SUPPORTFILESDIR=dir_name
       Where to install extra support files.

     * -DMYSQL_DATADIR=dir_name
       The location of the MySQL data directory.
       This value can be set at server startup with the --datadir
       option.

     * -DODBC_INCLUDES=dir_name
       The location of the ODBC includes directory, and may be used
       while configuring Connector/ODBC.

     * -DODBC_LIB_DIR=dir_name
       The location of the ODBC library directory, and may be used
       while configuring Connector/ODBC.

     * -DSYSCONFDIR=dir_name
       The default my.cnf option file directory.
       This location cannot be set at server startup, but you can
       start the server with a given option file using the
       --defaults-file=file_name option, where file_name is the full
       path name to the file.

     * -DTMPDIR=dir_name
       The default location to use for the tmpdir system variable. If
       unspecified, the value defaults to P_tmpdir in <stdio.h>. This
       option was added in MySQL 5.6.16.

Storage Engine Options

   Storage engines are built as plugins. You can build a plugin as a
   static module (compiled into the server) or a dynamic module
   (built as a dynamic library that must be installed into the server
   using the INSTALL PLUGIN statement or the --plugin-load option
   before it can be used). Some plugins might not support static or
   dynamic building.

   The MyISAM, MERGE, MEMORY, and CSV engines are mandatory (always
   compiled into the server) and need not be installed explicitly.

   To compile a storage engine statically into the server, use
   -DWITH_engine_STORAGE_ENGINE=1. Some permissible engine values are
   ARCHIVE, BLACKHOLE, EXAMPLE, FEDERATED, INNOBASE (InnoDB), NDB or
   NDBCLUSTER (NDB), PARTITION (partitioning support), and PERFSCHEMA
   (Performance Schema). Examples:
-DWITH_INNOBASE_STORAGE_ENGINE=1
-DWITH_ARCHIVE_STORAGE_ENGINE=1
-DWITH_BLACKHOLE_STORAGE_ENGINE=1
-DWITH_PERFSCHEMA_STORAGE_ENGINE=1

   Note

   WITH_NDBCLUSTER_STORAGE_ENGINE is supported only when building
   MySQL Cluster using the MySQL Cluster sources. It cannot be used
   to enable clustering support in other MySQL source trees or
   distributions. In MySQL Cluster NDB 7.3 source distributions, it
   is enabled by default. See Section 17.2.2.3, "Building MySQL
   Cluster from Source on Linux," and Section 17.2.3.2, "Compiling
   and Installing MySQL Cluster from Source on Windows," for more
   information.

   To exclude a storage engine from the build, use
   -DWITHOUT_engine_STORAGE_ENGINE=1. Examples:
-DWITHOUT_EXAMPLE_STORAGE_ENGINE=1
-DWITHOUT_FEDERATED_STORAGE_ENGINE=1
-DWITHOUT_PARTITION_STORAGE_ENGINE=1

   If neither -DWITH_engine_STORAGE_ENGINE nor
   -DWITHOUT_engine_STORAGE_ENGINE are specified for a given storage
   engine, the engine is built as a shared module, or excluded if it
   cannot be built as a shared module.

Feature Options


     * -DCOMPILATION_COMMENT=string
       A descriptive comment about the compilation environment.

     * -DDEFAULT_CHARSET=charset_name
       The server character set. By default, MySQL uses the latin1
       (cp1252 West European) character set.
       charset_name may be one of binary, armscii8, ascii, big5,
       cp1250, cp1251, cp1256, cp1257, cp850, cp852, cp866, cp932,
       dec8, eucjpms, euckr, gb2312, gbk, geostd8, greek, hebrew,
       hp8, keybcs2, koi8r, koi8u, latin1, latin2, latin5, latin7,
       macce, macroman, sjis, swe7, tis620, ucs2, ujis, utf8,
       utf8mb4, utf16, utf16le, utf32. The permissible character sets
       are listed in the cmake/character_sets.cmake file as the value
       of CHARSETS_AVAILABLE.
       This value can be set at server startup with the
       --character_set_server option.

     * -DDEFAULT_COLLATION=collation_name
       The server collation. By default, MySQL uses
       latin1_swedish_ci. Use the SHOW COLLATION statement to
       determine which collations are available for each character
       set.
       This value can be set at server startup with the
       --collation_server option.

     * -DENABLE_DEBUG_SYNC=bool
       Whether to compile the Debug Sync facility into the server.
       This facility is used for testing and debugging. This option
       is enabled by default, but has no effect unless MySQL is
       configured with debugging enabled. If debugging is enabled and
       you want to disable Debug Sync, use -DENABLE_DEBUG_SYNC=0.
       When compiled in, Debug Sync is disabled by default at
       runtime. To enable it, start mysqld with the
       --debug-sync-timeout=N option, where N is a timeout value
       greater than 0. (The default value is 0, which disables Debug
       Sync.) N becomes the default timeout for individual
       synchronization points.
       For a description of the Debug Sync facility and how to use
       synchronization points, see MySQL Internals: Test
       Synchronization
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/test-synchronization.ht
       ml).

     * -DENABLE_DOWNLOADS=bool
       Whether to download optional files. For example, with this
       option enabled, CMake downloads the Google Test distribution
       that is used by the test suite to run unit tests.

     * -DENABLE_DTRACE=bool
       Whether to include support for DTrace probes. For information
       about DTrace, wee Section 5.4, "Tracing mysqld Using DTrace"

     * -DENABLE_GCOV=bool
       Whether to include gcov support (Linux only).

     * -DENABLE_GPROF=bool
       Whether to enable gprof (optimized Linux builds only). This
       option was added in MySQL 5.6.6.

     * -DENABLED_LOCAL_INFILE=bool
       Whether to enable LOCAL capability in the client library for
       LOAD DATA INFILE.
       This option controls client-side LOCAL capability, but the
       capability can be set on the server side at server startup
       with the --local-infile option. See Section 6.1.6, "Security
       Issues with LOAD DATA LOCAL."

     * -DENABLED_PROFILING=bool
       Whether to enable query profiling code (for the SHOW PROFILE
       and SHOW PROFILES statements).

     * -DIGNORE_AIO_CHECK=bool
       If the -DBUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release option is given on Linux,
       the libaio library must be linked in by default. If you do not
       have libaio or do not want to install it, you can suppress the
       check for it by specifying -DIGNORE_AIO_CHECK=1. This option
       was added in MySQL 5.6.1.

     * -DINNODB_PAGE_ATOMIC_REF_COUNT=bool
       Whether to enable or disable atomic page reference counting.
       Fetching and releasing pages from the buffer pool and tracking
       the page state are expensive and complex operations. Using a
       page mutex to track these operations does not scale well. With
       INNODB_PAGE_ATOMIC_REF_COUNT=ON (default), fetch and release
       is tracked using atomics where available. For platforms that
       do not support atomics, set INNODB_PAGE_ATOMIC_REF_COUNT=OFF
       to disable atomic page reference counting.
       When atomic page reference counting is enabled (default),
       "[Note] InnoDB: Using atomics to ref count buffer pool pages"
       is printed to the error log at server startup. If atomic page
       reference counting is disabled, "[Note] InnoDB: Using mutexes
       to ref count buffer pool pages" is printed instead.
       This build option was introduced with the fix for MySQL Bug
       #68079.

     * -DMYSQL_MAINTAINER_MODE=bool
       Whether to enable a MySQL maintainer-specific development
       environment. If enabled, this option causes compiler warnings
       to become errors.

     * -DMYSQL_PROJECT_NAME=name
       For Windows or Mac OS X, the project name to incorporate into
       the project file name. This option was added in MySQL 5.6.5.

     * -DMYSQL_TCP_PORT=port_num
       The port number on on which the server listens for TCP/IP
       connections. The default is 3306.
       This value can be set at server startup with the --port
       option.

     * -DMYSQL_UNIX_ADDR=file_name
       The Unix socket file path on which the server listens for
       socket connections. This must be an absolute path name. The
       default is /tmp/mysql.sock.
       This value can be set at server startup with the --socket
       option.

     * -DOPTIMIZER_TRACE=bool
       Whether to support optimizer tracing. See MySQL Internals:
       Tracing the Optimizer
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/optimizer-tracing.html)
       . This option was added in MySQL 5.6.3.

     * -DWITH_ASAN=bool
       Whether to enable AddressSanitizer, for compilers that support
       it. The default is off. This option was added in MySQL 5.6.15.

     * -DWITH_DEBUG=bool
       Whether to include debugging support.
       Configuring MySQL with debugging support enables you to use
       the --debug="d,parser_debug" option when you start the server.
       This causes the Bison parser that is used to process SQL
       statements to dump a parser trace to the server's standard
       error output. Typically, this output is written to the error
       log.

     * -DWITH_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SET=bool
       Whether to use the flags from
       cmake/build_configurations/feature_set.cmake. This option was
       added in MySQL 5.6.6.

     * -DWITH_EDITLINE=value
       Which libedit/editline library to use. The permitted values
       are bundled (the default) and system.
       WITH_EDITLINE was added in MySQL 5.6.12. It replaces
       WITH_LIBEDIT, which has been removed.

     * -DWITH_EMBEDDED_SERVER=bool
       Whether to build the libmysqld embedded server library.

     * -DWITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=name
       Which extra character sets to include:

          + all: All character sets. This is the default.

          + complex: Complex character sets.

          + none: No extra character sets.

     * -DWITH_INNODB_MEMCACHED=bool
       Whether to generate memcached shared libraries
       (libmemcached.so and innodb_engine.so).

     * -DWITH_LIBEVENT=string
       Which libevent library to use. Permitted values are bundled
       (default), system, and yes. If you specify system or yes, the
       system libevent library is used if present. If the system
       library is not found, the bundled libevent library is used.
       The libevent library is required by InnoDB memcached.

     * -DWITH_LIBEDIT=bool
       Whether to use the libedit library bundled with the
       distribution.
       WITH_LIBEDIT was removed in MySQL 5.6.12. Use WITH_EDITLINE
       instead.

     * -DWITH_LIBWRAP=bool
       Whether to include libwrap (TCP wrappers) support.

     * -DWITH_READLINE=bool
       Whether to use the readline library bundled with the
       distribution. This option was removed in MySQL 5.6.5 because
       readline is no longer bundled.

     * -DWITH_SSL={ssl_type|path_name}

     * The type of SSL support to include (if any) or the path name
       to the OpenSSL installation to use.

          + ssl_type can be one of the following values:
               o no: No SSL support. This is the default before MySQL
                 5.6.6. As of 5.6.6, this is no longer a permitted
                 value and the default is bundled.
               o yes: Use the system SSL library if present, else the
                 library bundled with the distribution.
               o bundled: Use the SSL library bundled with the
                 distribution. This is the default as of MySQL 5.6.6.
               o system: Use the system SSL library.

          + path_name, permitted for MySQL 5.6.7 and after, is the
            path name to the OpenSSL installation to use. Using this
            can be preferable to using the ssl_type value of system,
            for it can prevent CMake from detecting and using an
            older or incorrect OpenSSL version installed on the
            system. (Another permitted way to do the same thing is to
            set the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH option to path_name.)
       For information about using SSL support, see Section 6.3.10,
       "Using SSL for Secure Connections."

     * -DWITH_UNIXODBC=1
       Enables unixODBC support, for Connector/ODBC.

     * -DWITH_ZLIB=zlib_type
       Some features require that the server be built with
       compression library support, such as the COMPRESS() and
       UNCOMPRESS() functions, and compression of the client/server
       protocol. The WITH_ZLIB indicates the source of zlib support:

          + bundled: Use the zlib library bundled with the
            distribution.

          + system: Use the system zlib library. This is the default.

     * -DWITHOUT_SERVER=bool
       Whether to build without the MySQL server. The default is OFF,
       which does build the server.

Compiler Flags


     * -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="flags"
       Flags for the C Compiler.

     * -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="flags"
       Flags for the C++ Compiler.

     * -DWITH_DEFAULT_COMPILER_OPTIONS=bool
       Whether to use the flags from
       cmake/build_configurations/compiler_options.cmake. This option
       was added in MySQL 5.6.6.
       Note
       All optimization flags were carefully chosen and tested by the
       MySQL build team. Overriding them can lead to unexpected
       results and is done at your own risk.

   To specify your own C and C++ compiler flags, for flags that do
   not affect optimization, use the CMAKE_C_FLAGS and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS
   CMake options.

   When providing your own compiler flags, you might want to specify
   CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE as well.

   For example, to create a 32-bit release build on a 64-bit Linux
   machine, do this:
shell> mkdir bld
shell> cd bld
shell> cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-m32 \
         -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-m32 \
         -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

   If you set flags that affect optimization (-Onumber), you must set
   the CMAKE_C_FLAGS_build_type and/or CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_build_type
   options, where build_type corresponds to the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
   value. To specify a different optimization for the default build
   type (RelWithDebInfo) set the CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO and
   CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO options. For example, to compile on
   Linux with -O3 and with debug symbols, do this:
shell> cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO="-O3 -g" \
         -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO="-O3 -g"

CMake Options for Compiling MySQL Cluster

   The following options are for use when building MySQL Cluster with
   the MySQL Cluster sources; they are not currently supported when
   using sources from the MySQL 5.6 Server tree.

     * -DMEMCACHED_HOME=path
       Perform the build using the memcached (version 1.6 or later)
       installed in the system directory indicated by path. Files
       from this installation that are used in the build include the
       memcached binary, header files, and libraries, as well as the
       memcached_utilities library and the header file
       engine_testapp.h.
       You must leave this option unset when building ndbmemcache
       using the bundled memcached sources (WITH_BUNDLED_MEMCACHED
       option); in other words, the bundled sources are used by
       default).
       This option was added in MySQL Cluster NDB 7.2.2.
       While additional CMake options---such as for SASL
       authorization and for providing dtrace support---are available
       for use when compiling memcached from external sources, these
       options are currently not enabled for the memcached sources
       bundled with MySQL Cluster.

     * -DWITH_BUNDLED_LIBEVENT={ON|OFF}
       Use the libevent included in the MySQL Cluster sources when
       building MySQL Cluster with ndbmemcached support (MySQL
       Cluster NDB 7.2.2 and later). Enabled by default. OFF causes
       the system's libevent to be used instead.

     * -DWITH_BUNDLED_MEMCACHED={ON|OFF}
       Build the memcached sources included in the MySQL Cluster
       source tree (MySQL Cluster NDB 7.2.3 and later), then use the
       resulting memcached server when building the ndbmemcache
       engine. In this case, make install places the memcached binary
       in the installation bin directory, and the ndbmemcache engine
       shared object file ndb_engine.so in the installation lib
       directory.
       This option is ON by default.

     * -DWITH_CLASSPATH=path
       Sets the classpath for building MySQL Cluster Connector for
       Java. The default is empty. In MySQL Cluster NDB 7.2.9 and
       later, this option is ignored if -DWITH_NDB_JAVA=OFF is used.

     * -DWITH_ERROR_INSERT={ON|OFF}
       Enables error injection in the NDB kernel. For testing only;
       not intended for use in building production binaries. The
       default is OFF.

     * -DWITH_NDBCLUSTER_STORAGE_ENGINE={ON|OFF}
       Build and link in support for the NDB (NDBCLUSTER) storage
       engine in mysqld. The default is ON.

     * -DWITH_NDBCLUSTER={ON|OFF}
       This is an alias for WITH_NDBCLUSTER_STORAGE_ENGINE.

     * -DWITH_NDBMTD={ON|OFF}
       Build the multi-threaded data node executable ndbmtd. The
       default is ON.

     * -DWITH_NDB_BINLOG={ON|OFF}
       Enable binary logging by default in the mysqld built using
       this option. ON by default.

     * -DWITH_NDB_DEBUG={ON|OFF}
       Enable building the debug versions of the MySQL Cluster
       binaries. OFF by default.

     * -DWITH_NDB_JAVA={ON|OFF}
       Enable building MySQL Cluster with Java support, including
       ClusterJ.
       This option was added in MySQL Cluster NDB 7.2.9, and is ON by
       default. If you do not wish to compile MySQL Cluster with Java
       support, you must disable it explicitly by specifying
       -DWITH_NDB_JAVA=OFF when running CMake. Otherwise, if Java
       cannot be found, configuration of the build fails.

     * -DWITH_NDB_PORT=port
       Causes the MySQL Cluster management server (ndb_mgmd) that is
       built to use this port by default. If this option is unset,
       the resulting management server tries to use port 1186 by
       default.

     * -DWITH_NDB_TEST={ON|OFF}
       If enabled, include a set of NDB API test programs. The
       default is OFF.

2.8.5 Dealing with Problems Compiling MySQL

   The solution to many problems involves reconfiguring. If you do
   reconfigure, take note of the following:

     * If CMake is run after it has previously been run, it may use
       information that was gathered during its previous invocation.
       This information is stored in CMakeCache.txt. When CMake
       starts up, it looks for that file and reads its contents if it
       exists, on the assumption that the information is still
       correct. That assumption is invalid when you reconfigure.

     * Each time you run CMake, you must run make again to recompile.
       However, you may want to remove old object files from previous
       builds first because they were compiled using different
       configuration options.

   To prevent old object files or configuration information from
   being used, run the following commands before re-running CMake:

   On Unix:
shell> make clean
shell> rm CMakeCache.txt

   On Windows:
shell> devenv MySQL.sln /clean
shell> del CMakeCache.txt

   If you build outside of the source tree, remove and recreate your
   build directory before re-running CMake. For instructions on
   building outside of the source tree, see How to Build MySQL Server
   with CMake (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/cmake.html).

   On some systems, warnings may occur due to differences in system
   include files. The following list describes other problems that
   have been found to occur most often when compiling MySQL:

     * To define which C and C++ compilers to use, you can define the
       CC and CXX environment variables. For example:
shell> CC=gcc
shell> CXX=g++
shell> export CC CXX
       To specify your own C and C++ compiler flags, use the
       CMAKE_C_FLAGS and CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS CMake options. See Section
       2.8.4, "."
       To see what flags you might need to specify, invoke
       mysql_config with the --cflags and --cxxflags options.

     * To see what commands are executed during the compile stage,
       after using CMake to configure MySQL, run make VERBOSE=1
       rather than just make.

     * If compilation fails, check whether the MYSQL_MAINTAINER_MODE
       option is enabled. This mode causes compiler warnings to
       become errors, so disabling it may enable compilation to
       proceed.

     * If your compile fails with errors such as any of the
       following, you must upgrade your version of make to GNU make:
make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 18:
Badly formed macro assignment
       Or:
make: file `Makefile' line 18: Must be a separator (:
       Or:
pthread.h: No such file or directory
       Solaris and FreeBSD are known to have troublesome make
       programs.
       GNU make 3.75 is known to work.

     * The sql_yacc.cc file is generated from sql_yacc.yy. Normally,
       the build process does not need to create sql_yacc.cc because
       MySQL comes with a pregenerated copy. However, if you do need
       to re-create it, you might encounter this error:
"sql_yacc.yy", line xxx fatal: default action causes potential...
       This is a sign that your version of yacc is deficient. You
       probably need to install a recent version of bison (the GNU
       version of yacc) and use that instead.
       Versions of bison older than 1.75 may report this error:
sql_yacc.yy:#####: fatal error: maximum table size (32767) exceeded
       The maximum table size is not actually exceeded; the error is
       caused by bugs in older versions of bison.

   For information about acquiring or updating tools, see the system
   requirements in Section 2.8, "Installing MySQL from Source."

2.8.6 MySQL Configuration and Third-Party Tools

   Third-party tools that need to determine the MySQL version from
   the MySQL source can read the VERSION file in the top-level source
   directory. The file lists the pieces of the version separately.
   For example, if the version is MySQL 5.7.4-m14, the file looks
   like this:
MYSQL_VERSION_MAJOR=5
MYSQL_VERSION_MINOR=7
MYSQL_VERSION_PATCH=4
MYSQL_VERSION_EXTRA=-m14

   If the source is not for a General Availablility (GA) release, the
   MYSQL_VERSION_EXTRA value will be nonempty. For the example, the
   value corresponds to Milestone 14.

   To construct a five-digit number from the version components, use
   this formula:
MYSQL_VERSION_MAJOR*10000 + MYSQL_VERSION_MINOR*100 + MYSQL_VERSION_P
ATCH

2.9 Postinstallation Setup and Testing

   This section discusses post-installation items for Unix-like
   systems. If you are using Windows, see Section 2.3.8, "Windows
   Postinstallation Procedures."

   After installing MySQL, there are some items that you should
   address. For example:

     * You should initialize the data directory and create the MySQL
       grant tables, as describe in Section 2.9.1, "Postinstallation
       Procedures for Unix-like Systems."

     * An important security concern is that the initial accounts in
       the grant tables have no passwords. You should assign
       passwords to prevent unauthorized access to the MySQL server.
       For instructions, see Section 2.9.2, "Securing the Initial
       MySQL Accounts."

     * Optionally, you can create time zone tables to enable
       recognition of named time zones. For instructions, see Section
       4.4.6, "mysql_tzinfo_to_sql --- Load the Time Zone Tables."

     * If you have trouble getting the server to start, see Section
       2.9.1.3, "Starting and Troubleshooting the MySQL Server."

     * When you are ready to create additional user accounts, you can
       find information on the MySQL access control system and
       account management in Section 6.2, "The MySQL Access Privilege
       System," and Section 6.3, "MySQL User Account Management."

2.9.1 Postinstallation Procedures for Unix-like Systems

   After installing MySQL on a Unix-like system, you must initialize
   the grant tables, start the server, and make sure that the server
   works satisfactorily. You may also wish to arrange for the server
   to be started and stopped automatically when your system starts
   and stops. You should also assign passwords to the accounts in the
   grant tables.

   On a Unix-like system, the grant tables are set up by the
   mysql_install_db program. For some installation methods, this
   program is run for you automatically if an existing database
   cannot be found.

     * If you install MySQL on Linux using RPM distributions, the
       server RPM runs mysql_install_db.

     * Using the native packaging system on many platforms, including
       Debian Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Gentoo Linux and others, the
       mysql_install_db command is run for you.

     * If you install MySQL on Mac OS X using a DMG distribution, the
       installer runs mysql_install_db.

   For other platforms and installation types, including generic
   binary and source installs, you will need to run mysql_install_db
   yourself.

   The following procedure describes how to initialize the grant
   tables (if that has not previously been done) and start the
   server. It also suggests some commands that you can use to test
   whether the server is accessible and working properly. For
   information about starting and stopping the server automatically,
   see Section 2.9.1.2, "Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically."

   After you complete the procedure and have the server running, you
   should assign passwords to the accounts created by
   mysql_install_db and perhaps restrict access to test databases.
   For instructions, see Section 2.9.2, "Securing the Initial MySQL
   Accounts."

   In the examples shown here, the server runs under the user ID of
   the mysql login account. This assumes that such an account exists.
   Either create the account if it does not exist, or substitute the
   name of a different existing login account that you plan to use
   for running the server. For information about creating the
   account, see Creating a mysql System User and Group, in Section
   2.2, "Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries."

    1. Change location into the top-level directory of your MySQL
       installation, represented here by BASEDIR:
shell> cd BASEDIR
       BASEDIR is the installation directory for your MySQL instance.
       It is likely to be something like /usr/local/mysql,
       /usr/local, or /usr/bin (for installation wtih MySQL Yum
       repository, or other means). The following steps assume that
       you have changed location to this directory.
       You will find several files and subdirectories in the BASEDIR
       directory. The most important for installation purposes are
       the bin and scripts subdirectories:

          + The bin directory contains client programs and the
            server. You should add the full path name of this
            directory to your PATH environment variable so that your
            shell finds the MySQL programs properly. See Section
            2.11, "Environment Variables."

          + The scripts directory contains the mysql_install_db
            script used to initialize the mysql database containing
            the grant tables that store the server access
            permissions.

    2. If necessary, ensure that the distribution contents are
       accessible to mysql. If you installed the distribution as
       mysql, no further action is required. If you installed the
       distribution as root, its contents will be owned by root.
       Change its ownership to mysql by executing the following
       commands as root in the installation directory. The first
       command changes the owner attribute of the files to the mysql
       user. The second changes the group attribute to the mysql
       group.
shell> chown -R mysql .
shell> chgrp -R mysql .

    3. If necessary, run the mysql_install_db program to set up the
       initial MySQL grant tables containing the privileges that
       determine how users are permitted to connect to the server.
       You will need to do this if you used a distribution type for
       which the installation procedure does not run the program for
       you.
shell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
       Typically, mysql_install_db needs to be run only the first
       time you install MySQL, so you can skip this step if you are
       upgrading an existing installation, However, mysql_install_db
       does not overwrite any existing privilege tables, so it should
       be safe to run in any circumstances.
       It might be necessary to specify other options such as
       --basedir or --datadir if mysql_install_db does not identify
       the correct locations for the installation directory or data
       directory. For example:
shell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql \
         --basedir=/opt/mysql/mysql \
         --datadir=/opt/mysql/mysql/data
       The mysql_install_db script creates the server's data
       directory with mysql as the owner. Under the data directory,
       it creates directories for the mysql database that holds the
       grant tables and the test database that you can use to test
       MySQL. The script also creates privilege table entries for
       root and anonymous-user accounts. The accounts have no
       passwords initially. Section 2.9.2, "Securing the Initial
       MySQL Accounts," describes the initial privileges. Briefly,
       these privileges permit the MySQL root user to do anything,
       and permit anybody to create or use databases with a name of
       test or starting with test_. See Section 6.2, "The MySQL
       Access Privilege System," for a complete listing and
       description of the grant tables.
       For a more secure installation, invoke mysql_install_db with
       the --random-passwords option. This causes it to assign a
       random password to the MySQL root accounts, set the "password
       expired" flag for those accounts, and remove the
       anonymous-user MySQL accounts. For additional details, see
       Section 4.4.3, "mysql_install_db --- Initialize MySQL Data
       Directory." (Install operations using RPMs for Unbreakable
       Linux Network are unaffected because they do not use
       mysql_install_db.)
       It is important to make sure that the database directories and
       files are owned by the mysql login account so that the server
       has read and write access to them when you run it later. To
       ensure this if you run mysql_install_db as root, include the
       --user option as shown. Otherwise, you should execute the
       script while logged in as mysql, in which case you can omit
       the --user option from the command.
       If you do not want to have the test database, you can remove
       it after starting the server, using the instructions in
       Section 2.9.2, "Securing the Initial MySQL Accounts."
       If you have trouble with mysql_install_db at this point, see
       Section 2.9.1.1, "Problems Running mysql_install_db."

    4. Most of the MySQL installation can be owned by root if you
       like. The exception is that the data directory must be owned
       by mysql. To accomplish this, run the following commands as
       root in the installation directory:
shell> chown -R root .
shell> chown -R mysql data

    5. If the plugin directory (the directory named by the plugin_dir
       system variable) is writable by the server, it may be possible
       for a user to write executable code to a file in the directory
       using SELECT ... INTO DUMPFILE. This can be prevented by
       making plugin_dir read only to the server or by setting
       --secure-file-priv to a directory where SELECT writes can be
       made safely.

    6. If you installed MySQL using a source distribution, you may
       want to optionally copy one of the provided configuration
       files from the support-files directory into your /etc
       directory. There are different sample configuration files for
       different use cases, server types, and CPU and RAM
       configurations. If you want to use one of these standard
       files, you should copy it to /etc/my.cnf, or /etc/mysql/my.cnf
       and edit and check the configuration before starting your
       MySQL server for the first time.
       If you do not copy one of the standard configuration files,
       the MySQL server will be started with the default settings.
       If you want MySQL to start automatically when you boot your
       machine, you can copy support-files/mysql.server to the
       location where your system has its startup files. More
       information can be found in the mysql.server script itself,
       and in Section 2.9.1.2, "Starting and Stopping MySQL
       Automatically."

    7. Start the MySQL server:
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
       It is important that the MySQL server be run using an
       unprivileged (non-root) login account. To ensure this if you
       run mysqld_safe as root, include the --user option as shown.
       Otherwise, you should execute the script while logged in as
       mysql, in which case you can omit the --user option from the
       command.
       For further instructions for running MySQL as an unprivileged
       user, see Section 6.1.5, "How to Run MySQL as a Normal User."
       If the command fails immediately and prints mysqld ended, look
       for information in the error log (which by default is the
       host_name.err file in the data directory).
       If you neglected to create the grant tables by running
       mysql_install_db before proceeding to this step, the following
       message appears in the error log file when you start the
       server:
mysqld: Can't find file: 'host.frm'
       This error also occurs if you run mysql_install_db as root
       without the --user option. Remove the data directory and run
       mysql_install_db with the --user option as described
       previously.
       If you have other problems starting the server, see Section
       2.9.1.3, "Starting and Troubleshooting the MySQL Server." For
       more information about mysqld_safe, see Section 4.3.2,
       "mysqld_safe --- MySQL Server Startup Script."

    8. Use mysqladmin to verify that the server is running. The
       following commands provide simple tests to check whether the
       server is up and responding to connections:
shell> bin/mysqladmin version
shell> bin/mysqladmin variables
       The output from mysqladmin version varies slightly depending
       on your platform and version of MySQL, but should be similar
       to that shown here:
shell> bin/mysqladmin version
mysqladmin  Ver 14.12 Distrib 5.6.18, for pc-linux-gnu on i686
...

Server version          5.6.18
Protocol version        10
Connection              Localhost via UNIX socket
UNIX socket             /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

Threads: 1  Questions: 366  Slow queries: 0
Opens: 0  Flush tables: 1  Open tables: 19
Queries per second avg: 0.000
       To see what else you can do with mysqladmin, invoke it with
       the --help option.

    9. Verify that you can shut down the server:
shell> bin/mysqladmin -u root shutdown
   10. Verify that you can start the server again. Do this by using
       mysqld_safe or by invoking mysqld directly. For example:
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
       If mysqld_safe fails, see Section 2.9.1.3, "Starting and
       Troubleshooting the MySQL Server."
   11. Run some simple tests to verify that you can retrieve
       information from the server. The output should be similar to
       what is shown here:
shell> bin/mysqlshow
+--------------------+
|     Databases      |

   12. There is a benchmark suite in the sql-bench directory (under
       the MySQL installation directory) that you can use to compare
       how MySQL performs on different platforms. The benchmark suite
       is written in Perl. It requires the Perl DBI module that
       provides a database-independent interface to the various
       databases, and some other additional Perl modules:
DBI
DBD::mysql
Data::Dumper
Data::ShowTable
       These modules can be obtained from CPAN
       (http://www.cpan.org/). See also Section 2.12.1, "Installing
       Perl on Unix."
       The sql-bench/Results directory contains the results from many
       runs against different databases and platforms. To run all
       tests, execute these commands:
shell> cd sql-bench
shell> perl run-all-tests
       If you do not have the sql-bench directory, you probably
       installed MySQL using RPM files other than the source RPM.
       (The source RPM includes the sql-bench benchmark directory.)
       In this case, you must first install the benchmark suite
       before you can use it. There are separate benchmark RPM files
       named mysql-bench-VERSION.i386.rpm that contain benchmark code
       and data.
       If you have a source distribution, there are also tests in its
       tests subdirectory that you can run. For example, to run
       auto_increment.tst, execute this command from the top-level
       directory of your source distribution:
shell> mysql -vvf test < ./tests/auto_increment.tst
       The expected result of the test can be found in the
       ./tests/auto_increment.res file.
   13. At this point, you should have the server running. However,
       none of the initial MySQL accounts have a password, and the
       server permits permissive access to test databases. To tighten
       security, follow the instructions in Section 2.9.2, "Securing
       the Initial MySQL Accounts."

   The MySQL 5.6 installation procedure creates time zone tables in
   the mysql database but does not populate them. To do so, use the
   instructions in Section 10.6, "MySQL Server Time Zone Support."

   To make it more convenient to invoke programs installed in the bin
   directory under the installation directory, you can add that
   directory to your PATH environment variable setting. That enables
   you to run a program by typing only its name, not its entire path
   name. See Section 4.2.4, "Setting Environment Variables."

2.9.1.1 Problems Running mysql_install_db

   The purpose of the mysql_install_db script is to generate new
   MySQL privilege tables. It does not overwrite existing MySQL
   privilege tables, and it does not affect any other data.

   If you want to re-create your privilege tables, first stop the
   mysqld server if it is running. Then rename the mysql directory
   under the data directory to save it, and then run
   mysql_install_db. Suppose that your current directory is the MySQL
   installation directory and that mysql_install_db is located in the
   bin directory and the data directory is named data. To rename the
   mysql database and re-run mysql_install_db, use these commands.
shell> mv data/mysql data/mysql.old
shell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql

   When you run mysql_install_db, you might encounter the following
   problems:

     * mysql_install_db fails to install the grant tables
       You may find that mysql_install_db fails to install the grant
       tables and terminates after displaying the following messages:
Starting mysqld daemon with databases from XXXXXX
mysqld ended
       In this case, you should examine the error log file very
       carefully. The log should be located in the directory XXXXXX
       named by the error message and should indicate why mysqld did
       not start. If you do not understand what happened, include the
       log when you post a bug report. See Section 1.7, "How to
       Report Bugs or Problems."

     * There is a mysqld process running
       This indicates that the server is running, in which case the
       grant tables have probably been created already. If so, there
       is no need to run mysql_install_db at all because it needs to
       be run only once (when you install MySQL the first time).

     * Installing a second mysqld server does not work when one
       server is running
       This can happen when you have an existing MySQL installation,
       but want to put a new installation in a different location.
       For example, you might have a production installation, but you
       want to create a second installation for testing purposes.
       Generally the problem that occurs when you try to run a second
       server is that it tries to use a network interface that is in
       use by the first server. In this case, you should see one of
       the following error messages:
Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port:
Address already in use
Can't start server: Bind on unix socket...
       For instructions on setting up multiple servers, see Section
       5.3, "Running Multiple MySQL Instances on One Machine."

     * You do not have write access to the /tmp directory
       If you do not have write access to create temporary files or a
       Unix socket file in the default location (the /tmp directory)
       or the TMP_DIR environment variable, if it has been set, an
       error occurs when you run mysql_install_db or the mysqld
       server.
       You can specify different locations for the temporary
       directory and Unix socket file by executing these commands
       prior to starting mysql_install_db or mysqld, where
       some_tmp_dir is the full path name to some directory for which
       you have write permission:
shell> TMPDIR=/some_tmp_dir/
shell> MYSQL_UNIX_PORT=/some_tmp_dir/mysql.sock
shell> export TMPDIR MYSQL_UNIX_PORT
       Then you should be able to run mysql_install_db and start the
       server with these commands:
shell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
       If mysql_install_db is located in the scripts directory,
       modify the first command to scripts/mysql_install_db.
       See Section C.5.4.5, "How to Protect or Change the MySQL Unix
       Socket File," and Section 2.11, "Environment Variables."

   There are some alternatives to running the mysql_install_db script
   provided in the MySQL distribution:

     * If you want the initial privileges to be different from the
       standard defaults, you can modify mysql_install_db before you
       run it. However, it is preferable to use GRANT and REVOKE to
       change the privileges after the grant tables have been set up.
       In other words, you can run mysql_install_db, and then use
       mysql -u root mysql to connect to the server as the MySQL root
       user so that you can issue the necessary GRANT and REVOKE
       statements.
       If you want to install MySQL on several machines with the same
       privileges, you can put the GRANT and REVOKE statements in a
       file and execute the file as a script using mysql after
       running mysql_install_db. For example:
shell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
shell> bin/mysql -u root < your_script_file
       By doing this, you can avoid having to issue the statements
       manually on each machine.

     * It is possible to re-create the grant tables completely after
       they have previously been created. You might want to do this
       if you are just learning how to use GRANT and REVOKE and have
       made so many modifications after running mysql_install_db that
       you want to wipe out the tables and start over.
       To re-create the grant tables, remove all the .frm, .MYI, and
       .MYD files in the mysql database directory. Then run the
       mysql_install_db script again.

     * You can start mysqld manually using the --skip-grant-tables
       option and add the privilege information yourself using mysql:
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql --skip-grant-tables &
shell> bin/mysql mysql
       From mysql, manually execute the SQL commands contained in
       mysql_install_db. Make sure that you run mysqladmin
       flush-privileges or mysqladmin reload afterward to tell the
       server to reload the grant tables.
       Note that by not using mysql_install_db, you not only have to
       populate the grant tables manually, you also have to create
       them first.

2.9.1.2 Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically

   Generally, you start the mysqld server in one of these ways:

     * Invoke mysqld directly. This works on any platform.

     * Invoke mysqld_safe, which tries to determine the proper
       options for mysqld and then runs it with those options. This
       script is used on Unix and Unix-like systems. See Section
       4.3.2, "mysqld_safe --- MySQL Server Startup Script."

     * Invoke mysql.server. This script is used primarily at system
       startup and shutdown on systems that use System V-style run
       directories (that is, /etc/init.d and run-level specific
       directories), where it usually is installed under the name
       mysql. The mysql.server script starts the server by invoking
       mysqld_safe. See Section 4.3.3, "mysql.server --- MySQL Server
       Startup Script."

     * On Mac OS X, install a separate MySQL Startup Item package to
       enable the automatic startup of MySQL on system startup. The
       Startup Item starts the server by invoking mysql.server. See
       Section 2.4.3, "Installing the MySQL Startup Item," for
       details. A MySQL Preference Pane also provides control for
       starting and stopping MySQL through the System Preferences,
       see Section 2.4.4, "Installing and Using the MySQL Preference
       Pane."

     * Use the Solaris/OpenSolaris service management framework (SMF)
       system to initiate and control MySQL startup. For more
       information, see Section 2.6.2, "Installing MySQL on
       OpenSolaris Using IPS."

   The mysqld_safe and mysql.server scripts, Solaris/OpenSolaris SMF,
   and the Mac OS X Startup Item (or MySQL Preference Pane) can be
   used to start the server manually, or automatically at system
   startup time. mysql.server and the Startup Item also can be used
   to stop the server.

   To start or stop the server manually using the mysql.server
   script, invoke it with start or stop arguments:
shell> mysql.server start
shell> mysql.server stop

   Before mysql.server starts the server, it changes location to the
   MySQL installation directory, and then invokes mysqld_safe. If you
   want the server to run as some specific user, add an appropriate
   user option to the [mysqld] group of the /etc/my.cnf option file,
   as shown later in this section. (It is possible that you will need
   to edit mysql.server if you've installed a binary distribution of
   MySQL in a nonstandard location. Modify it to change location into
   the proper directory before it runs mysqld_safe. If you do this,
   your modified version of mysql.server may be overwritten if you
   upgrade MySQL in the future, so you should make a copy of your
   edited version that you can reinstall.)

   mysql.server stop stops the server by sending a signal to it. You
   can also stop the server manually by executing mysqladmin
   shutdown.

   To start and stop MySQL automatically on your server, you need to
   add start and stop commands to the appropriate places in your
   /etc/rc* files.

   If you use the Linux server RPM package
   (MySQL-server-VERSION.rpm), or a native Linux package
   installation, the mysql.server script may be installed in the
   /etc/init.d directory with the name mysql. See Section 2.5.3,
   "Installing MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages," for more
   information on the Linux RPM packages.

   Some vendors provide RPM packages that install a startup script
   under a different name such as mysqld.

   If you install MySQL from a source distribution or using a binary
   distribution format that does not install mysql.server
   automatically, you can install it manually. The script can be
   found in the support-files directory under the MySQL installation
   directory or in a MySQL source tree.

   To install mysql.server manually, copy it to the /etc/init.d
   directory with the name mysql, and then make it executable. Do
   this by changing location into the appropriate directory where
   mysql.server is located and executing these commands:
shell> cp mysql.server /etc/init.d/mysql
shell> chmod +x /etc/init.d/mysql

   Note

   Older Red Hat systems use the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory rather
   than /etc/init.d. Adjust the preceding commands accordingly.
   Alternatively, first create /etc/init.d as a symbolic link that
   points to /etc/rc.d/init.d:
shell> cd /etc
shell> ln -s rc.d/init.d .

   After installing the script, the commands needed to activate it to
   run at system startup depend on your operating system. On Linux,
   you can use chkconfig:
shell> chkconfig --add mysql

   On some Linux systems, the following command also seems to be
   necessary to fully enable the mysql script:
shell> chkconfig --level 345 mysql on

   On FreeBSD, startup scripts generally should go in
   /usr/local/etc/rc.d/. The rc(8) manual page states that scripts in
   this directory are executed only if their basename matches the
   *.sh shell file name pattern. Any other files or directories
   present within the directory are silently ignored. In other words,
   on FreeBSD, you should install the mysql.server script as
   /usr/local/etc/rc.d/mysql.server.sh to enable automatic startup.

   As an alternative to the preceding setup, some operating systems
   also use /etc/rc.local or /etc/init.d/boot.local to start
   additional services on startup. To start up MySQL using this
   method, you could append a command like the one following to the
   appropriate startup file:
/bin/sh -c 'cd /usr/local/mysql; ./bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &'

   For other systems, consult your operating system documentation to
   see how to install startup scripts.

   You can add options for mysql.server in a global /etc/my.cnf file.
   A typical /etc/my.cnf file might look like this:
[mysqld]
datadir=/usr/local/mysql/var
socket=/var/tmp/mysql.sock
port=3306
user=mysql

[mysql.server]
basedir=/usr/local/mysql

   The mysql.server script supports the following options: basedir,
   datadir, and pid-file. If specified, they must be placed in an
   option file, not on the command line. mysql.server supports only
   start and stop as command-line arguments.

   The following table shows which option groups the server and each
   startup script read from option files.

   Table 2.14 MySQL Startup scripts and supported server option
   groups
      Script                  Option Groups
   mysqld       [mysqld], [server], [mysqld-major_version]
   mysqld_safe  [mysqld], [server], [mysqld_safe]
   mysql.server [mysqld], [mysql.server], [server]

   [mysqld-major_version] means that groups with names like
   [mysqld-5.5] and [mysqld-5.6] are read by servers having versions
   5.5.x, 5.6.x, and so forth. This feature can be used to specify
   options that can be read only by servers within a given release
   series.

   For backward compatibility, mysql.server also reads the
   [mysql_server] group and mysqld_safe also reads the [safe_mysqld]
   group. However, you should update your option files to use the
   [mysql.server] and [mysqld_safe] groups instead when using MySQL
   5.6.

   For more information on MySQL configuration files and their
   structure and contents, see Section 4.2.3.3, "Using Option Files."

2.9.1.3 Starting and Troubleshooting the MySQL Server

   This section provides troubleshooting suggestions for problems
   starting the server on a Unix-like system. If you are using
   Windows, see Section 2.3.6, "Troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows
   MySQL Server Installation."

   If you have problems starting the server, here are some things to
   try:

     * Check the error log to see why the server does not start. Log
       files are located in the data directory (typically C:\Program
       Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\data on Windows,
       /usr/local/mysql/data for a Unix/Linux binary distribution,
       and /usr/local/var for a Unix/Linux source distribution). Look
       in the data directory for files with names of the form
       host_name.err and host_name.log, where host_name is the name
       of your server host. Then examine the last few lines of these
       files. Use tail to display them:
shell> tail host_name.err
shell> tail host_name.log

     * Specify any special options needed by the storage engines you
       are using. You can create a my.cnf file and specify startup
       options for the engines that you plan to use. If you are going
       to use storage engines that support transactional tables
       (InnoDB, NDB), be sure that you have them configured the way
       you want before starting the server. If you are using InnoDB
       tables, see Section 14.2.3, "InnoDB Configuration" for
       guidelines and Section 14.2.13, "InnoDB Startup Options and
       System Variables" for option syntax.
       Although storage engines use default values for options that
       you omit, Oracle recommends that you review the available
       options and specify explicit values for any options whose
       defaults are not appropriate for your installation.

     * Make sure that the server knows where to find the data
       directory. The mysqld server uses this directory as its
       current directory. This is where it expects to find databases
       and where it expects to write log files. The server also
       writes the pid (process ID) file in the data directory.
       The default data directory location is hardcoded when the
       server is compiled. To determine what the default path
       settings are, invoke mysqld with the --verbose and --help
       options. If the data directory is located somewhere else on
       your system, specify that location with the --datadir option
       to mysqld or mysqld_safe, on the command line or in an option
       file. Otherwise, the server will not work properly. As an
       alternative to the --datadir option, you can specify mysqld
       the location of the base directory under which MySQL is
       installed with the --basedir, and mysqld looks for the data
       directory there.
       To check the effect of specifying path options, invoke mysqld
       with those options followed by the --verbose and --help
       options. For example, if you change location into the
       directory where mysqld is installed and then run the following
       command, it shows the effect of starting the server with a
       base directory of /usr/local:
shell> ./mysqld --basedir=/usr/local --verbose --help
       You can specify other options such as --datadir as well, but
       --verbose and --help must be the last options.
       Once you determine the path settings you want, start the
       server without --verbose and --help.
       If mysqld is currently running, you can find out what path
       settings it is using by executing this command:
shell> mysqladmin variables
       Or:
shell> mysqladmin -h host_name variables
       host_name is the name of the MySQL server host.

     * Make sure that the server can access the data directory. The
       ownership and permissions of the data directory and its
       contents must allow the server to read and modify them.
       If you get Errcode 13 (which means Permission denied) when
       starting mysqld, this means that the privileges of the data
       directory or its contents do not permit server access. In this
       case, you change the permissions for the involved files and
       directories so that the server has the right to use them. You
       can also start the server as root, but this raises security
       issues and should be avoided.
       Change location into the data directory and check the
       ownership of the data directory and its contents to make sure
       the server has access. For example, if the data directory is
       /usr/local/mysql/var, use this command:
shell> ls -la /usr/local/mysql/var
       If the data directory or its files or subdirectories are not
       owned by the login account that you use for running the
       server, change their ownership to that account. If the account
       is named mysql, use these commands:
shell> chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/var
shell> chgrp -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/var
       Even with correct ownership, MySQL might fail to start up if
       there is other security software running on your system that
       manages application access to various parts of the file
       system. In this case, reconfigure that software to enable
       mysqld to access the directories it uses during normal
       operation.

     * Verify that the network interfaces the server wants to use are
       available.
       If either of the following errors occur, it means that some
       other program (perhaps another mysqld server) is using the
       TCP/IP port or Unix socket file that mysqld is trying to use:
Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Address already in use
Can't start server: Bind on unix socket...
       Use ps to determine whether you have another mysqld server
       running. If so, shut down the server before starting mysqld
       again. (If another server is running, and you really want to
       run multiple servers, you can find information about how to do
       so in Section 5.3, "Running Multiple MySQL Instances on One
       Machine.")
       If no other server is running, execute the command telnet
       your_host_name tcp_ip_port_number. (The default MySQL port
       number is 3306.) Then press Enter a couple of times. If you do
       not get an error message like telnet: Unable to connect to
       remote host: Connection refused, some other program is using
       the TCP/IP port that mysqld is trying to use. Track down what
       program this is and disable it, or tell mysqld to listen to a
       different port with the --port option. In this case, specify
       the same non-default port number for client programs when
       connecting to the server using TCP/IP.
       Another reason the port might be inaccessible is that you have
       a firewall running that blocks connections to it. If so,
       modify the firewall settings to permit access to the port.
       If the server starts but you cannot connect to it, make sure
       that you have an entry in /etc/hosts that looks like this:
127.0.0.1       localhost

     * If you cannot get mysqld to start, try to make a trace file to
       find the problem by using the --debug option. See Section
       23.4.3, "The DBUG Package."

2.9.2 Securing the Initial MySQL Accounts

   Part of the MySQL installation process is to set up the mysql
   database that contains the grant tables:

     * Windows distributions contain preinitialized grant tables.

     * On Unix, the mysql_install_db program populates the grant
       tables. Some installation methods run this program for you.
       Others require that you execute it manually. For details, see
       Section 2.9.1, "Postinstallation Procedures for Unix-like
       Systems."

   The mysql.user grant table defines the initial MySQL user accounts
   and their access privileges:

     * Some accounts have the user name root. These are superuser
       accounts that have all privileges and can do anything. The
       initial root account passwords are empty, so anyone can
       connect to the MySQL server as root without a password and be
       granted all privileges.

          + On Windows, root accounts are created that permit
            connections from the local host only. Connections can be
            made by specifying the host name localhost, the IP
            address 127.0.0.1, or the IPv6 address ::1. If the user
            selects the Enable root access from remote machines
            option during installation, the Windows installer creates
            another root account that permits connections from any
            host.

          + On Unix, each root account permits connections from the
            local host. Connections can be made by specifying the
            host name localhost, the IP address 127.0.0.1, the IPv6
            address ::1, or the actual host name or IP address.
       An attempt to connect to the host 127.0.0.1 normally resolves
       to the localhost account. However, this fails if the server is
       run with the --skip-name-resolve option, so the 127.0.0.1
       account is useful in that case. The ::1 account is used for
       IPv6 connections.

     * Some accounts are for anonymous users. These have an empty
       user name. The anonymous accounts have no password, so anyone
       can use them to connect to the MySQL server.

          + On Windows, there is one anonymous account that permits
            connections from the local host. Connections can be made
            by specifying a host name of localhost.

          + On Unix, each anonymous account permits connections from
            the local host. Connections can be made by specifying a
            host name of localhost for one of the accounts, or the
            actual host name or IP address for the other.

   To display which accounts exist in the mysql.user table and check
   whether their passwords are empty, use the following statement:
mysql> SELECT User, Host, Password FROM mysql.user;
+------+--------------------+----------+
| User | Host               | Password |
+------+--------------------+----------+
| root | localhost          |          |
| root | myhost.example.com |          |
| root | 127.0.0.1          |          |
| root | ::1                |          |
|      | localhost          |          |
|      | myhost.example.com |          |
+------+--------------------+----------+

   This output indicates that there are several root and
   anonymous-user accounts, none of which have passwords. The output
   might differ on your system, but the presence of accounts with
   empty passwords means that your MySQL installation is unprotected
   until you do something about it:

     * You should assign a password to each MySQL root account.

     * If you want to prevent clients from connecting as anonymous
       users without a password, you should either assign a password
       to each anonymous account or else remove the accounts.

   In addition, the mysql.db table contains rows that permit all
   accounts to access the test database and other databases with
   names that start with test_. This is true even for accounts that
   otherwise have no special privileges such as the default anonymous
   accounts. This is convenient for testing but inadvisable on
   production servers. Administrators who want database access
   restricted only to accounts that have permissions granted
   explicitly for that purpose should remove these mysql.db table
   rows.

   The following instructions describe how to set up passwords for
   the initial MySQL accounts, first for the root accounts, then for
   the anonymous accounts. The instructions also cover how to remove
   the anonymous accounts, should you prefer not to permit anonymous
   access at all, and describe how to remove permissive access to
   test databases. Replace newpwd in the examples with the password
   that you want to use. Replace host_name with the name of the
   server host. You can determine this name from the output of the
   preceding SELECT statement. For the output shown, host_name is
   myhost.example.com.
   Note

   For additional information about setting passwords, see Section
   6.3.5, "Assigning Account Passwords." If you forget your root
   password after setting it, see Section C.5.4.1, "How to Reset the
   Root Password."

   You might want to defer setting the passwords until later, to
   avoid the need to specify them while you perform additional setup
   or testing. However, be sure to set them before using your
   installation for production purposes.

   To set up additional accounts, see Section 6.3.2, "Adding User
   Accounts."

Assigning root Account Passwords

   The root account passwords can be set several ways. The following
   discussion demonstrates three methods:

     * Use the SET PASSWORD statement

     * Use the UPDATE statement

     * Use the mysqladmin command-line client program

   To assign passwords using SET PASSWORD, connect to the server as
   root and issue a SET PASSWORD statement for each root account
   listed in the mysql.user table. Be sure to encrypt the password
   using the PASSWORD() function.

   For Windows, do this:
shell> mysql -u root
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('newpwd');
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'127.0.0.1' = PASSWORD('newpwd');
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'::1' = PASSWORD('newpwd');
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'%' = PASSWORD('newpwd');

   The last statement is unnecessary if the mysql.user table has no
   root account with a host value of %.

   For Unix, do this:
shell> mysql -u root
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('newpwd');
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'127.0.0.1' = PASSWORD('newpwd');
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'::1' = PASSWORD('newpwd');
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'host_name' = PASSWORD('newpwd');

   You can also use a single statement that assigns a password to all
   root accounts by using UPDATE to modify the mysql.user table
   directly. This method works on any platform:
shell> mysql -u root
mysql> UPDATE mysql.user SET Password = PASSWORD('newpwd')
    ->     WHERE User = 'root';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

   The FLUSH statement causes the server to reread the grant tables.
   Without it, the password change remains unnoticed by the server
   until you restart it.

   To assign passwords to the root accounts using mysqladmin, execute
   the following commands:
shell> mysqladmin -u root password "newpwd"
shell> mysqladmin -u root -h host_name password "newpwd"

   Those commands apply both to Windows and to Unix. The double
   quotation marks around the password are not always necessary, but
   you should use them if the password contains spaces or other
   characters that are special to your command interpreter.

   The mysqladmin method of setting the root account passwords does
   not work for the 'root'@'127.0.0.1' or 'root'@'::1' account. Use
   the SET PASSWORD method shown earlier.

   After the root passwords have been set, you must supply the
   appropriate password whenever you connect as root to the server.
   For example, to shut down the server with mysqladmin, use this
   command:
shell> mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown
Enter password: (enter root password here)

Assigning Anonymous Account Passwords

   The mysql commands in the following instructions include a -p
   option based on the assumption that you have set the root account
   passwords using the preceding instructions and must specify that
   password when connecting to the server.

   To assign passwords to the anonymous accounts, connect to the
   server as root, then use either SET PASSWORD or UPDATE. Be sure to
   encrypt the password using the PASSWORD() function.

   To use SET PASSWORD on Windows, do this:
shell> mysql -u root -p
Enter password: (enter root password here)
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR ''@'localhost' = PASSWORD('newpwd');

   To use SET PASSWORD on Unix, do this:
shell> mysql -u root -p
Enter password: (enter root password here)
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR ''@'localhost' = PASSWORD('newpwd');
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR ''@'host_name' = PASSWORD('newpwd');

   To set the anonymous-user account passwords with a single UPDATE
   statement, do this (on any platform):
shell> mysql -u root -p
Enter password: (enter root password here)
mysql> UPDATE mysql.user SET Password = PASSWORD('newpwd')
    ->     WHERE User = '';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

   The FLUSH statement causes the server to reread the grant tables.
   Without it, the password change remains unnoticed by the server
   until you restart it.

Removing Anonymous Accounts

   If you prefer to remove any anonymous accounts rather than
   assigning them passwords, do so as follows on Windows:
shell> mysql -u root -p
Enter password: (enter root password here)
mysql> DROP USER ''@'localhost';

   On Unix, remove the anonymous accounts like this:
shell> mysql -u root -p
Enter password: (enter root password here)
mysql> DROP USER ''@'localhost';
mysql> DROP USER ''@'host_name';

Securing Test Databases

   By default, the mysql.db table contains rows that permit access by
   any user to the test database and other databases with names that
   start with test_. (These rows have an empty User column value,
   which for access-checking purposes matches any user name.) This
   means that such databases can be used even by accounts that
   otherwise possess no privileges. If you want to remove any-user
   access to test databases, do so as follows:
shell> mysql -u root -p
Enter password: (enter root password here)
mysql> DELETE FROM mysql.db WHERE Db LIKE 'test%';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

   The FLUSH statement causes the server to reread the grant tables.
   Without it, the privilege change remains unnoticed by the server
   until you restart it.

   With the preceding change, only users who have global database
   privileges or privileges granted explicitly for the test database
   can use it. However, if you do not want the database to exist at
   all, drop it:
mysql> DROP DATABASE test;

   Note

   On Windows, you can also perform the process described in this
   section during installation with MySQL Installer (see Section
   2.3.3, "Installing MySQL on Microsoft Windows Using MySQL
   Installer"). On all platforms, the MySQL distribution includes
   mysql_secure_installation, a command-line utility that automates
   much of the process of securing a MySQL installation. And MySQL
   Workbench is available on all platforms, and also offers the
   ability to manage user accounts (see Chapter 25, "MySQL Workbench"
   ).

2.10 Upgrading or Downgrading MySQL

   This section describes the steps to upgrade or downgrade a MySQL
   installation.

   Upgrading is a common procedure, as you pick up bug fixes within
   the same MySQL release series or significant features between
   major MySQL releases. You perform this procedure first on some
   test systems to make sure everything works smoothly, and then on
   the production systems.

   Downgrading is less common. Typically, you undo an upgrade because
   of some compatibility or performance issue that occurs on a
   production system, and was not uncovered during initial upgrade
   verification on the test systems. As with the upgrade procedure,
   perform and verify the downgrade procedure on some test systems
   first, before using it on a production system.

2.10.1 Upgrading MySQL

   As a general rule, to upgrade from one release series to another,
   go to the next series rather than skipping a series. To upgrade
   from a release series previous to MySQL 5.5, upgrade to each
   successive release series in turn until you have reached MySQL
   5.5, and then proceed with the upgrade to MySQL 5.6. For example,
   if you currently are running MySQL 5.1 and wish to upgrade to a
   newer series, upgrade to MySQL 5.5 first before upgrading to 5.6,
   and so forth. For information on upgrading to MySQL 5.5, see the
   MySQL 5.5 Reference Manual.

   To upgrade to MySQL 5.6, use the items in the following checklist
   as a guide:

     * Before any upgrade, back up your databases, including the
       mysql database that contains the grant tables. See Section
       7.2, "Database Backup Methods."

     * Read all the notes in Section 2.10.1.2, "Upgrading from MySQL
       5.5 to 5.6." These notes enable you to identify upgrade issues
       that apply to your current MySQL installation. Some
       incompatibilities discussed in that section require your
       attention before upgrading. Others require some action after
       upgrading.

     * Read the Release Notes
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/) as well,
       which provide information about features that are new in MySQL
       5.6 or differ from those found in earlier MySQL releases.

     * After upgrading to a new version of MySQL, run mysql_upgrade
       (see Section 4.4.7, "mysql_upgrade --- Check and Upgrade MySQL
       Tables"). This program checks your tables, and attempts to
       repair them if necessary. It also updates your grant tables to
       make sure that they have the current structure so that you can
       take advantage of any new capabilities. (Some releases of
       MySQL introduce changes to the structure of the grant tables
       to add new privileges or features.)
       mysql_upgrade does not upgrade the contents of the help
       tables. For upgrade instructions, see Section 5.1.10,
       "Server-Side Help."
       mysql_upgrade should not be used when the server is running
       with --gtid-mode=ON, since it may make changes in
       nontransactional system tables in the mysql database, many of
       which are MyISAM and cannot be changed to use a different
       storage engine. See Section 16.1.3.4, "GTID mode and
       mysql_upgrade."

     * If you run MySQL Server on Windows, see Section 2.3.7,
       "Upgrading MySQL on Windows."

     * If you use replication, see Section 16.4.3, "Upgrading a
       Replication Setup," for information on upgrading your
       replication setup.

     * If you use InnoDB, consider setting innodb_fast_shutdown to 0
       before shutting down and upgrading your server. When you set
       innodb_fast_shutdown to 0, InnoDB does a slow shutdown, a full
       purge and an insert buffer merge before shutting down, which
       ensures that all data files are fully prepared in case the
       upgrade process modifies the file format.

     * If you upgrade an installation originally produced by
       installing multiple RPM packages, it is best to upgrade all
       the packages, not just some. For example, if you previously
       installed the server and client RPMs, do not upgrade just the
       server RPM.

     * If you have created a user-defined function (UDF) with a given
       name and upgrade MySQL to a version that implements a new
       built-in function with the same name, the UDF becomes
       inaccessible. To correct this, use DROP FUNCTION to drop the
       UDF, and then use CREATE FUNCTION to re-create the UDF with a
       different nonconflicting name. The same is true if the new
       version of MySQL implements a built-in function with the same
       name as an existing stored function. See Section 9.2.4,
       "Function Name Parsing and Resolution," for the rules
       describing how the server interprets references to different
       kinds of functions.

   For EL5, EL6, or EL7-based Linux platforms and Fedora 19 or 20,
   you can perform an in-place upgrade of MySQL and its components to
   the latest GA releases with the MySQL Yum repository. See Section
   2.10.1.1, "Upgrading MySQL with the MySQL Yum Repository."

   For upgrades between versions of a MySQL release series that has
   reached General Availability status, you can move the MySQL format
   files and data files between different versions on systems with
   the same architecture. For upgrades to a version of a MySQL
   release series that is in development status, that is not
   necessarily true. Use of development releases is at your own risk.

   If you are cautious about using new versions, you can always
   rename your old mysqld before installing a newer one. For example,
   if you are using a version of MySQL 5.5 and want to upgrade to
   5.6, rename your current server from mysqld to mysqld-5.5. If your
   new mysqld then does something unexpected, you can simply shut it
   down and restart with your old mysqld.

   If problems occur, such as that the new mysqld server does not
   start or that you cannot connect without a password, verify that
   you do not have an old my.cnf file from your previous
   installation. You can check this with the --print-defaults option
   (for example, mysqld --print-defaults). If this command displays
   anything other than the program name, you have an active my.cnf
   file that affects server or client operation.

   If, after an upgrade, you experience problems with compiled client
   programs, such as Commands out of sync or unexpected core dumps,
   you probably have used old header or library files when compiling
   your programs. In this case, check the date for your mysql.h file
   and libmysqlclient.a library to verify that they are from the new
   MySQL distribution. If not, recompile your programs with the new
   headers and libraries. Recompilation might also be necessary for
   programs compiled against the shared client library if the library
   major version number has changed (for example from
   libmysqlclient.so.15 to libmysqlclient.so.16.

   If your MySQL installation contains a large amount of data that
   might take a long time to convert after an in-place upgrade, you
   might find it useful to create a "dummy" database instance for
   assessing what conversions might be needed and the work involved
   to perform them. Make a copy of your MySQL instance that contains
   a full copy of the mysql database, plus all other databases
   without data. Run your upgrade procedure on this dummy instance to
   see what actions might be needed so that you can better evaluate
   the work involved when performing actual data conversion on your
   original database instance.

   It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the Perl DBD::mysql
   module whenever you install a new release of MySQL. The same
   applies to other MySQL interfaces as well, such as PHP mysql
   extensions and the Python MySQLdb module.

2.10.1.1 Upgrading MySQL with the MySQL Yum Repository

   For EL5, EL6, or EL7-based Linux platforms and Fedora 19 or 20,
   you can upgrade MySQL and its components to the latest GA releases
   with the MySQL Yum repository.
   Note

   Before you perform any upgrade actions, please pay attention to
   the following:

     * If your version of MySQL is more than one series older than
       the latest GA series (for example, assuming the current GA
       release series is 5.6 and you have 5.1.x installed right now),
       do NOT use the following instructions to update MySQL, and do
       NOT enable the MySQL Yum repository on your system until you
       have upgraded MySQL by other means (see Section 2.10.1,
       "Upgrading MySQL") to at least the last GA series before the
       latest one.

     * Before performing any update to MySQL, follow carefully the
       instructions in Section 2.10.1, "Upgrading MySQL." Among other
       instructions discussed there, it is especially important to
       back up your database before the update.

     * If your MySQL installation is a third-party distribution,
       follow the instructions in Section 2.5.2, "Replacing a
       Third-Party Distribution of MySQL Using the MySQL Yum
       Repository" for upgrading the installation.

   The Yum update performs an in-place update for MySQL (that is,
   replaces the old version of the software and then runs the new
   version off the old version's data files). It updates MySQL to the
   latest release in the same release series. Assuming that you
   already have the MySQL Yum repository on your system's repository
   list (see Section 2.5.1, "" for details), make sure your Yum
   repository setup is up-to-date by running:
shell> sudo yum update mysql-community-release

   You can then update MySQL and its components by the following
   command:
shell> sudo yum update mysql-server

   Alternatively, you can update the MySQL Yum repository setup and
   MySQL at the same time by telling Yum to update everything on your
   system (this might take considerably more time):
shell> sudo yum update

   Note that by default, the yum update command will only update
   MySQL to the latest version in the same release series, which
   means, for example, a 5.6.x installation will NOT be updated to a
   5.7.x release automatically. To update to the next release series,
   after updating the MySQL Yum repository setup as described above,
   you need to first disable the sub-repository for your original
   version and enable the sub-repository for your target version
   before you run the yum update command for MySQL. See the
   instructions for doing that in Section 2.5.1, "."
   Important

   For important information about upgrading from MySQL 5.6 to 5.7,
   see Upgrading from MySQL 5.6 to 5.7
   (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/upgrading-from-previous-se
   ries.html).

   The MySQL server always restarts after an update by Yum. Once the
   server restarts, you should run mysql_upgrade to check and
   possibly resolve any incompatibilities between the old data and
   the upgraded software. mysql_upgrade also performs other
   functions; see Section 4.4.7, "mysql_upgrade --- Check and Upgrade
   MySQL Tables" for details.

   Although we recommend that you update all the MySQL components at
   the same time, you can also update only a specific component. You
   can use the following command to list all the installed packages
   for the MySQL components, which can all be updated with the MySQL
   Yum repository:
shell> sudo yum list installed | grep "^mysql"

   After identifying the package name of the component of your
   choice, update the package with the following command, replacing
   package-name with the name of the package:
shell> sudo yum update package-name

Upgrading the Shared Client Libraries

   After updating MySQL using the Yum repository, applications
   compiled with older versions of the shared client libraries should
   continue to work.

   If you recompile applications and dynamically link them with the
   updated libraries: As typical with new versions of shared
   libraries where there are differences or additions in symbol
   versioning between the newer and older libraries (for example,
   between the newer, standard 5.6 shared client libraries and some
   older---prior or variant---versions of the shared libraries
   shipped natively by the Linux distributions' software
   repositories, or from some other sources), any applications
   compiled using the updated, newer shared libraries will require
   those updated libraries on systems where the applications are
   deployed. And, as expected, if those libraries are not in place,
   the applications requiring the shared libraries will fail. So, be
   sure to deploy the packages for the shared libraries from MySQL on
   those systems. You can do this by adding the MySQL Yum repository
   to the systems (see Section 2.5.1, "") and install the latest
   shared libraries using the instructions given in Section 2.5.1,
   "."

2.10.1.2 Upgrading from MySQL 5.5 to 5.6

   Note

   Beginning with MySQL 5.6.6, several MySQL Server parameters have
   defaults that differ from previous releases. See the notes
   regarding these changes later in this section, particularly
   regarding overriding them to preserve backward compatibility if
   that is a concern.
   Note

   It is good practice to back up your data before installing any new
   version of software. Although MySQL works very hard to ensure a
   high level of quality, protect your data by making a backup.

   To upgrade to 5.6 from any previous version, MySQL recommends that
   you dump your tables with mysqldump before upgrading and reload
   the dump file after upgrading. Use the --all-databases option to
   include all databases in the dump. If your databases include
   stored programs, use the --routines and --events options as well.

   In general, do the following when upgrading from MySQL 5.5 to 5.6:

     * Read all the items in these sections to see whether any of
       them might affect your applications:

          + Section 2.10.1, "Upgrading MySQL," has general update
            information.

          + The items in the change lists provided later in this
            section enable you to identify upgrade issues that apply
            to your current MySQL installation. Some
            incompatibilities discussed there require your attention
            before upgrading. Others should be dealt with after
            upgrading.

          + The MySQL 5.6 Release Notes
            (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/)
            describe significant new features you can use in 5.6 or
            that differ from those found in earlier MySQL releases.
            Some of these changes may result in incompatibilities.
       Note particularly any changes that are marked Known issue or
       Incompatible change. These incompatibilities with earlier
       versions of MySQL may require your attention before you
       upgrade. Our aim is to avoid these changes, but occasionally
       they are necessary to correct problems that would be worse
       than an incompatibility between releases. If any upgrade issue
       applicable to your installation involves an incompatibility
       that requires special handling, follow the instructions given
       in the incompatibility description. Sometimes this involves
       dumping and reloading tables, or use of a statement such as
       CHECK TABLE or REPAIR TABLE.
       For dump and reload instructions, see Section 2.10.4,
       "Rebuilding or Repairing Tables or Indexes." Any procedure
       that involves REPAIR TABLE with the USE_FRM option must be
       done before upgrading. Use of this statement with a version of
       MySQL different from the one used to create the table (that
       is, using it after upgrading) may damage the table. See
       Section 13.7.2.5, "REPAIR TABLE Syntax."

     * Before upgrading to a new version of MySQL, Section 2.10.3,
       "Checking Whether Tables or Indexes Must Be Rebuilt," to see
       whether changes to table formats or to character sets or
       collations were made between your current version of MySQL and
       the version to which you are upgrading. If so and these
       changes result in an incompatibility between MySQL versions,
       you will need to upgrade the affected tables using the
       instructions in Section 2.10.4, "Rebuilding or Repairing
       Tables or Indexes."

     * After upgrading to a new version of MySQL, run mysql_upgrade
       (see Section 4.4.7, "mysql_upgrade --- Check and Upgrade MySQL
       Tables"). This program checks your tables, and attempts to
       repair them if necessary. It also updates your grant tables to
       make sure that they have the current structure so that you can
       take advantage of any new capabilities. (Some releases of
       MySQL introduce changes to the structure of the grant tables
       to add new privileges or features.)
       mysql_upgrade does not upgrade the contents of the help
       tables. For upgrade instructions, see Section 5.1.10,
       "Server-Side Help."

     * If you run MySQL Server on Windows, see Section 2.3.7,
       "Upgrading MySQL on Windows."

     * If you use replication, see Section 16.4.3, "Upgrading a
       Replication Setup," for information on upgrading your
       replication setup.

   If your MySQL installation contains a large amount of data that
   might take a long time to convert after an in-place upgrade, you
   might find it useful to create a "dummy" database instance for
   assessing what conversions might be needed and the work involved
   to perform them. Make a copy of your MySQL instance that contains
   a full copy of the mysql database, plus all other databases
   without data. Run your upgrade procedure on this dummy instance to
   see what actions might be needed so that you can better evaluate
   the work involved when performing actual data conversion on your
   original database instance.

   Read all the items in the following sections to see whether any of
   them might affect your applications:

Configuration Changes


     * Beginning with MySQL 5.6.6, several MySQL Server parameters
       have defaults that differ from previous releases. The
       motivation for these changes is to provide better out-of-box
       performance and to reduce the need for the database
       administrator to change settings manually. These changes are
       subject to possible revision in future releases as we gain
       feedback.
       In some cases, a parameter has a different static default
       value. In other cases, the server autosizes a parameter at
       startup using a formula based on other related parameters or
       server host configuration, rather than using a static value.
       For example, the setting for back_log now is its previous
       default of 50, adjusted up by an amount proportional to the
       value of max_connections. The idea behind autosizing is that
       when the server has information available to make a decision
       about a parameter setting likely to be better than a fixed
       default, it will.
       The following table summarizes changes to defaults. Any of
       these can be overridden by specifying an explicit value at
       server startup.

   Parameter Old Default New Default
   back_log 50 Autosized using max_connections
   binlog_checksum NONE CRC32
   --binlog-row-event-max-size 1024 8192
   flush_time 1800 (on Windows) 0
   innodb_autoextend_increment 8 64
   innodb_buffer_pool_instances 1 8 (platform dependent)
   innodb_checksum_algorithm INNODB CRC32
   innodb_concurrency_tickets 500 5000
   innodb_file_per_table 0 1
   innodb_old_blocks_time 0 1000
   innodb_open_files 300 Autosized using innodb_file_per_table,
   table_open_cache
   innodb_stats_on_metadata ON OFF
   join_buffer_size 128KB 256KB
   max_allowed_packet 1MB 4MB
   max_connect_errors 10 100
   sync_master_info 0 10000
   sync_relay_log 0 10000
   sync_relay_log_info 0 10000
       With regard to compatibility with previous releases, the most
       important changes are:

          + innodb_file_per_table is enabled (previously disabled).

          + innodb_checksum_algorithm is CRC32 (previously INNODB).

          + binlog_checksum is CRC32 (previously NONE).
       Therefore, if you are upgrading an existing MySQL
       installation, have not already changed the values of these
       parameters from their previous defaults, and backward
       compatibility is a concern, you may want to explicitly set
       these parameters to their previous defaults. For example, put
       these lines in the server option file:
[mysqld]
innodb_file_per_table=0
innodb_checksum_algorithm=INNODB
binlog_checksum=NONE
       Those settings preserve compatibility as follows:

          + With the new default of innodb_file_per_table enabled,
            ALTER TABLE operations following an upgrade will move
            InnoDB tables that are in the system tablespace to
            individual .ibd files. Using innodb_file_per_table=0 will
            prevent this from happening.

          + Setting innodb_checksum_algorithm=INNODB permits binary
            downgrades after upgrading to this release. With a
            setting of CRC32, InnoDB would use checksumming that
            older MySQL versions cannot use.

          + With binlog_checksum=NONE, the server can be used as a
            replication master without causing failure of older
            slaves that do not understand binary log checksums.

     * As of MySQL 5.6.5, pre-4.1 passwords and the
       mysql_old_password authentication plugin are deprecated.
       Passwords stored in the older hash format used before MySQL
       4.1 are less secure than passwords that use the native
       password hashing method and should be avoided. To prevent
       connections using accounts that have pre-4.1 password hashes,
       the secure_auth system variable is now enabled by default. (To
       permit connections for accounts that have such password
       hashes, start the server with --secure_auth=0.)
       DBAs are advised to convert accounts that use the
       mysql_old_password authentication plugin to use
       mysql_native_password instead. For account upgrade
       instructions, see Section 6.3.8.3, "Migrating Away from
       Pre-4.1 Password Hashing and the mysql_old_password Plugin."
       Known issue: In some early development versions of MySQL 5.6
       (5.6.6 to 5.6.10), the server could create accounts with a
       mismatched password hash and authentication plugin. For
       example, if the default authentication plugin is
       mysql_native_password, this sequence of statements results in
       an account with a plugin of mysql_native_password but a
       pre-4.1 password hash (the format used by mysql_old_password):
SET old_passwords = 1;
CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypass';
       The mismatch produces symptoms such as being unable to connect
       to the MySQL server and being unable to use SET PASSWORD with
       OLD_PASSWORD() or with old_passwords=1.
       As of MySQL 5.6.11, this mismatch no longer occurs. Instead,
       the server produces an error:
mysql> SET old_passwords = 1;
mysql> CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypass';
ERROR 1827 (HY000): The password hash doesn't have the expected
format. Check if the correct password algorithm is being used with
the PASSWORD() function.
       To deal with an account affected by a mismatch, the DBA can
       modify either the plugin or Password column in the account's
       mysql.user table row to be consistent with the other column:

          + Set old_passwords to 0, then assign a new password to the
            account using SET PASSWORD and PASSWORD(). This sets the
            Password column to have a 4.1 password hash, consistent
            with the mysql_native_password plugin. This is the
            preferred method of fixing the account.

          + Alternatively, the DBA can change the plugin to
            mysql_old_password to make the plugin match the password
            hash format, then flush the privileges. This is not
            recommended because the mysql_old_password plugin and
            pre-4.1 password hashing are deprecated and support for
            them will be removed in a future version of MySQL.

Server Changes


     * Incompatible change: It is possible for a column DEFAULT value
       to be valid for the sql_mode value at table-creation time but
       invalid for the sql_mode value when rows are inserted or
       updated. Example:
SET sql_mode = '';
CREATE TABLE t (d DATE DEFAULT 0);
SET sql_mode = 'NO_ZERO_DATE,STRICT_ALL_TABLES';
INSERT INTO t (d) VALUES(DEFAULT);
       In this case, 0 should be accepted for the CREATE TABLE but
       rejected for the INSERT. However, the server did not evaluate
       DEFAULT values used for inserts or updates against the current
       sql_mode. In the example, the INSERT succeeds and inserts
       '0000-00-00' into the DATE column.
       As of MySQL 5.6.13, the server applies the proper sql_mode
       checks to generate a warning or error at insert or update
       time.
       A resulting incompatibility for replication if you use
       statement-based logging (binlog_format=STATEMENT) is that if a
       slave is upgraded, a nonupgraded master will execute the
       preceding example without error, whereas the INSERT will fail
       on the slave and replication will stop.
       To deal with this, stop all new statements on the master and
       wait until the slaves catch up. Then upgrade the slaves
       followed by the master. Alternatively, if you cannot stop new
       statements, temporarily change to row-based logging on the
       master (binlog_format=ROW) and wait until all slaves have
       processed all binary logs produced up to the point of this
       change. Then upgrade the slaves followed by the master and
       change the master back to statement-based logging.

     * Incompatible change: MySQL 5.6.11 and later supports CREATE
       TABLE ... [SUB]PARTITION BY ALGORITHM=n [LINEAR] KEY (...),
       which can be used to create a table whose KEY partitioning is
       compatible with a MySQL 5.1 server (n=1). (Bug #14521864, Bug
       #66462) This syntax is not accepted by MySQL 5.6.10 and
       earlier, although it is supported in MySQL 5.5 beginning with
       MySQL 5.5.31. mysqldump in MySQL 5.5.31 and later MySQL 5.5
       releases includes the ALGORITHM option when dumping tables
       using this option, but surrounds it with conditional comments,
       like this:
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT)
/*!50100 PARTITION BY KEY */ /*!50531 ALGORITHM = 1 */ /*!50100 ()
      PARTITIONS 3 */
       When importing a dump containing such CREATE TABLE statements
       into a MySQL 5.6.10 or earlier MySQL 5.6 server, the versioned
       comment is not ignored, which causes a syntax error.
       Therefore, prior to importing such a dump file, you must
       either change the comments so that the MySQL 5.6 server
       ignores them (by removing the string !50531 or replacing it
       with !50611, wherever it occurs), or remove them.
       This is not an issue with dump files made using MySQL 5.6.11
       or later, where the ALGORITHM option is written using /*!50611
       ... */.

     * Incompatible change: For TIME, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP
       columns, the storage required for tables created before MySQL
       5.6.4 differs from storage required for tables created in
       5.6.4 and later. This is due to a change in 5.6.4 that permits
       these temporal types to have a fractional part. After
       upgrading from MySQL 5.5 to MySQL 5.6.4 or later, it is
       recommended that you also upgrade from MySQL 5.5 to MySQL 5.6
       TIME, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP types. ALTER TABLE currently
       allows the creation of tables containing temporal columns in
       both MySQL 5.5 and MySQL 5.6.4 (or later) binary format but
       this makes it more difficult to recreate tables in cases where
       .frm files are not available. Additionally, as of MySQL 5.6.4,
       the aforementioned temporal types are more space efficient.
       For more information about changes to temporal types in MySQL
       5.6.4, see Section 11.6, "."

     * Due to the temporal type changes described in the previous
       incompatible change item above, importing pre-MySQL 5.6.4
       tables that contain DATETIME and TIMESTAMP types into MySQL
       5.6.4 (or later) fails. Importing a MySQL 5.5 table with these
       temporal types into MySQL 5.6.4 (or later) is the mostly
       likely scenario for this problem to occur.
       The following procedures describe workarounds that use the
       original pre-MySQL 5.6.4 .frm file to recreate a table with a
       row structure that is compatible with 5.6.4 (or later). The
       procedures involve changing the original pre-MySQL 5.6.4 .frm
       file to use the Memory storage engine instead of InnoDB,
       copying the .frm file to the data directory of the destination
       instance, and using ALTER TABLE to change the table's storage
       engine type back to InnoDB. Use the first procedure if your
       tables do not have foreign keys. Use the second procedure,
       which has additional steps, if your table includes foreign
       keys.
       If the table does not have foreign keys:

         1. Copy the table's original .frm file to the data directory
            on the server where you want to import the tablespace.

         2. Modify the table's .frm file to use the Memory storage
            engine instead of the InnoDB storage engine. This
            modification requires changing 7 bytes in the .frm file
            that define the table's storage engine type. Using a
            hexidecimal editing tool:
               o Change the byte at offset position 0003, which is
                 the legacy_db_type, from "0c" (for InnoDB) to "06"
                 (for Memory), as shown below:
00000000  fe 01 09 06 03 00 00 10  01 00 00 30 00 00 10 00
               o The remaining 6 bytes do not have a fixed offset.
                 Search the .frm file for "InnoDB" to locate the line
                 with the other 6 bytes. The line appears as shown
                 below:
00001010  ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 06  00 49 6e 6e 6f 44 42 00  |........
.InnoDB.|
               o Modify the bytes so that the line appears as
                 follows:
00001010  ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 06 00 4d 45 4d 4f 52 59 00

         3. Run ALTER TABLE ... ENGINE=INNODB to add the table
            definition to the InnoDB data dictionary. This creates
            the InnoDB table with the temporal data types in the new
            format. For the ALTER TABLE operation to complete
            successfully, the .frm file must correspond to the
            tablespace.

         4. Import the table using ALTER TABLE ... IMPORT TABLESPACE.
       If table has foreign keys:

         1. Recreate the tables with foreign keys using table
            definitions from SHOW CREATE TABLE output. The incorrect
            temporal column formats do not matter at this point.

         2. Dump all foreign key definitions to a text file by
            selecting the foreign key information from
            INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS and
            INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE.

         3. Drop all tables and complete the table import process
            described in steps 1 to 4 in the procedure described
            above for tables without foreign keys.

         4. After the import operation is complete, add the foreign
            keys from foreign key definitions that you saved to a
            text file.

     * Incompatible change: As of MySQL 5.6, the full-text stopword
       file is loaded and searched using latin1 if
       character_set_server is ucs2, utf16, utf16le, or utf32. If any
       table was created with FULLTEXT indexes while the server
       character set was ucs2, utf16, utf16le, or utf32, repair it
       using this statement:
REPAIR TABLE tbl_name QUICK;

SQL Changes


     * Some keywords may be reserved in MySQL 5.6 that were not
       reserved in MySQL 5.5. See Section 9.3, "Reserved Words."

     * The YEAR(2) data type has certain issues that you should
       consider before choosing to use it. As of MySQL 5.6.6, YEAR(2)
       is deprecated. YEAR(2) columns in existing tables are treated
       as before, but YEAR(2) in new or altered tables are converted
       to YEAR(4). For more information, see Section 11.3.4, "YEAR(2)
       Limitations and Migrating to YEAR(4)."

     * As of MySQL 5.6.6, it is explicitly disallowed to assign the
       value DEFAULT to stored procedure or function parameters or
       stored program local variables (for example with a SET
       var_name = DEFAULT statement). This was not previously
       supported, or documented as permitted, but is flagged as an
       incompatible change in case existing code inadvertently used
       this construct. It remains permissible to assign DEFAULT to
       system variables, as before, but assigning DEFAULT to
       parameters or local variables now results in a syntax error.
       After an upgrade to MySQL 5.6.6 or later, existing stored
       programs that use this construct produce a syntax error when
       invoked. If a mysqldump file from 5.6.5 or earlier is loaded
       into 5.6.6 or later, the load operation fails and affected
       stored program definitions must be changed.

     * In MySQL, the TIMESTAMP data type differs in nonstandard ways
       from other data types:

          + TIMESTAMP columns not explicitly declared with the NULL
            attribute are assigned the NOT NULL attribute. (Columns
            of other data types, if not explicitly declared as NOT
            NULL, permit NULL values.) Setting such a column to NULL
            sets it to the current timestamp.

          + The first TIMESTAMP column in a table, if not declared
            with the NULL attribute or an explicit DEFAULT or ON
            UPDATE clause, is automatically assigned the DEFAULT
            CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
            attributes.

          + TIMESTAMP columns following the first one, if not
            declared with the NULL attribute or an explicit DEFAULT
            clause, are automatically assigned DEFAULT '0000-00-00
            00:00:00' (the "zero" timestamp). For inserted rows that
            specify no explicit value for such a column, the column
            is assigned '0000-00-00 00:00:00' and no warning occurs.
       Those nonstandard behaviors remain the default for TIMESTAMP
       but as of MySQL 5.6.6 are deprecated and this warning appears
       at startup:
[Warning] TIMESTAMP with implicit DEFAULT value is deprecated.
Please use --explicit_defaults_for_timestamp server option (see
documentation for more details).
       As indicated by the warning, to turn off the nonstandard
       behaviors, enable the new explicit_defaults_for_timestamp
       system variable at server startup. With this variable enabled,
       the server handles TIMESTAMP as follows instead:

          + TIMESTAMP columns not explicitly declared as NOT NULL
            permit NULL values. Setting such a column to NULL sets it
            to NULL, not the current timestamp.

          + No TIMESTAMP column is assigned the DEFAULT
            CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
            attributes automatically. Those attributes must be
            explicitly specified.

          + TIMESTAMP columns declared as NOT NULL and without an
            explicit DEFAULT clause are treated as having no default
            value. For inserted rows that specify no explicit value
            for such a column, the result depends on the SQL mode. If
            strict SQL mode is enabled, an error occurs. If strict
            SQL mode is not enabled, the column is assigned the
            implicit default of '0000-00-00 00:00:00' and a warning
            occurs. This is similar to how MySQL treats other
            temporal types such as DATETIME.
       To upgrade servers used for replication, upgrade the slaves
       first, then the master. Replication between the master and its
       slaves should work provided that all use the same value of
       explicit_defaults_for_timestamp:

         1. Bring down the slaves, upgrade them, configure them with
            the desired value of explicit_defaults_for_timestamp, and
            bring them back up.
            The slaves will recognize from the format of the binary
            logs received from the master that the master is older
            (predates the introduction of
            explicit_defaults_for_timestamp) and that operations on
            TIMESTAMP columns coming from the master use the old
            TIMESTAMP behavior.

         2. Bring down the master, upgrade it, and configure it with
            the same explicit_defaults_for_timestamp value used on
            the slaves, and bring it back up.

2.10.2 Downgrading MySQL

   This section describes what to do to downgrade to an older MySQL
   version, in the unlikely case that the previous version worked
   better than the new one.

   It is always a good idea to make a backup beforehand, in case a
   downgrade fails and leaves the instance in an unusable state.

   To downgrade between General Availability (GA) status versions
   within the same release series, typically you just install the new
   binaries on top of the old ones and do not make any changes to the
   databases.

   Downgrades between milestone releases (or from a GA release to a
   milestone release) within the same release series are not
   supported and you may encounter issues.

   The following items form a checklist of things to do whenever you
   perform a downgrade:

     * Read the upgrading section for the release series from which
       you are downgrading to be sure that it does not have any
       features you really need. See Section 2.10.1, "Upgrading
       MySQL."

     * If there is a downgrading section for that version, read that
       as well.

     * To see which new features were added between the version to
       which you are downgrading and your current version, see the
       Release Notes
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/).

     * Check Section 2.10.3, "Checking Whether Tables or Indexes Must
       Be Rebuilt," to see whether changes to table formats or to
       character sets or collations were made between your current
       version of MySQL and the version to which you are downgrading.
       If so and these changes result in an incompatibility between
       MySQL versions, you will need to downgrade the affected tables
       using the instructions in Section 2.10.4, "Rebuilding or
       Repairing Tables or Indexes."

   In most cases, you can move the MySQL format files and data files
   between different GA versions on the same architecture as long as
   you stay within versions for the same release series of MySQL.

   If you downgrade from one release series to another, there may be
   incompatibilities in table storage formats. In this case, use
   mysqldump to dump your tables before downgrading. After
   downgrading, reload the dump file using mysql or mysqlimport to
   re-create your tables. For examples, see Section 2.10.5, "Copying
   MySQL Databases to Another Machine."

   A typical symptom of a downward-incompatible table format change
   when you downgrade is that you cannot open tables. In that case,
   use the following procedure:

    1. Stop the older MySQL server that you are downgrading to.

    2. Restart the newer MySQL server you are downgrading from.

    3. Dump any tables that were inaccessible to the older server by
       using mysqldump to create a dump file.

    4. Stop the newer MySQL server and restart the older one.

    5. Reload the dump file into the older server. Your tables should
       be accessible.

   If system tables in the mysql database changed, downgrading might
   introduce some loss of functionality or require some adjustments.
   Here are some examples:

     * Trigger creation requires the TRIGGER privilege as of MySQL
       5.1. In MySQL 5.0, there is no TRIGGER privilege and SUPER is
       required instead. If you downgrade from MySQL 5.1 to 5.0, you
       will need to give the SUPER privilege to those accounts that
       had the TRIGGER privilege in 5.1.

     * Triggers were added in MySQL 5.0, so if you downgrade from 5.0
       to 4.1, you cannot use triggers at all.

     * The mysql.proc.comment column definition changed between MySQL
       5.1 and 5.5. After a downgrade from 5.5 to 5.1, this table is
       seen as corrupt and in need of repair. To workaround this
       problem, execute mysql_upgrade from the version of MySQL to
       which you downgraded.

2.10.2.1 Downgrading to MySQL 5.5

   When downgrading to MySQL 5.5 from MySQL 5.6, keep in mind the
   following issues relating to features found in MySQL 5.6, but not
   in MySQL 5.5:

System Tables


     * The mysql.user table in MySQL 5.6 has a password_expired
       column. The mysql.user table in MySQL 5.5 does not. This means
       that an account with an expired password in MySQL 5.6 will
       work normally in MySQL 5.5.

Data Types


     * For TIME, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP columns, the storage
       required for tables created before MySQL 5.6.4 differs from
       storage required for tables created in 5.6.4 and later. This
       is due to a change in 5.6.4 that permits these temporal types
       to have a fractional part. To downgrade to a version older
       than 5.6.4, dump affected tables with mysqldump before
       downgrading, and reload the tables after downgrading.

InnoDB


     * InnoDB search indexes (with a type of FULLTEXT), introduced in
       MySQL 5.6.4, are not compatible with earlier versions of
       MySQL, including earlier releases in the 5.6 series. Drop such
       indexes before performing a downgrade.

     * InnoDB small page sizes specified by the innodb_page_size
       configuration option, introduced in MySQL 5.6.4, are not
       compatible with earlier versions of MySQL, including earlier
       releases in the 5.6 series. Dump all InnoDB tables in
       instances that use a smaller InnoDB page size, drop the
       tables, and re-create and reload them after the downgrade.

Replication


     * As of MySQL 5.6, the relay-log.info file contains a line count
       and a replication delay value, so the file format differs from
       that in older versions. See Section 16.2.2.2, "Slave Status
       Logs." If you downgrade a slave server to a version older than
       MySQL 5.6, the older server will not read the file correctly.
       To address this, modify the file in a text editor to delete
       the initial line containing the number of lines.

     * Beginning with MySQL 5.6.6, the MySQL Server employs Version 2
       binary log events when writing the binary log. Binary logs
       written using Version 2 log events cannot by read by earlier
       versions of MySQL Server. To generate a binary log that is
       written using Version 1 log events readable by older servers,
       start the MySQL 5.6.6 or later server using
       --log-bin-use-v1-row-events=1, which forces the server to
       employ Version 1 events when writing the binary log.

2.10.3 Checking Whether Tables or Indexes Must Be Rebuilt

   A binary upgrade or downgrade is one that installs one version of
   MySQL "in place" over an existing version, without dumping and
   reloading tables:

    1. Stop the server for the existing version if it is running.

    2. Install a different version of MySQL. This is an upgrade if
       the new version is higher than the original version, a
       downgrade if the version is lower.

    3. Start the server for the new version.

   In many cases, the tables from the previous version of MySQL can
   be used without problem by the new version. However, sometimes
   changes occur that require tables or table indexes to be rebuilt,
   as described in this section. If you have tables that are affected
   by any of the issues described here, rebuild the tables or indexes
   as necessary using the instructions given in Section 2.10.4,
   "Rebuilding or Repairing Tables or Indexes."

Table Incompatibilities

   After a binary upgrade to MySQL 5.1 from a MySQL 5.0 installation
   that contains ARCHIVE tables, accessing those tables causes the
   server to crash, even if you have run mysql_upgrade or CHECK TABLE
   ... FOR UPGRADE. To work around this problem, use mysqldump to
   dump all ARCHIVE tables before upgrading, and reload them into
   MySQL 5.1 after upgrading. The same problem occurs for binary
   downgrades from MySQL 5.1 to 5.0.

   The upgrade problem is fixed in MySQL 5.6.4: The server can open
   ARCHIVE tables created in MySQL 5.0. However, it remains the
   recommended upgrade procedure to dump 5.0 ARCHIVE tables before
   upgrading and reload them after upgrading.

Index Incompatibilities

   In MySQL 5.6.3, the length limit for index prefix keys is
   increased from 767 bytes to 3072 bytes, for InnoDB tables using
   ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC or ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED. See Section 14.2.6.7,
   "Limits on InnoDB Tables" for details. This change is also
   backported to MySQL 5.5.14. If you downgrade from one of these
   releases or higher, to an earlier release with a lower length
   limit, the index prefix keys could be truncated at 767 bytes or
   the downgrade could fail. This issue could only occur if the
   configuration option innodb_large_prefix was enabled on the server
   being downgraded.

   If you perform a binary upgrade without dumping and reloading
   tables, you cannot upgrade directly from MySQL 4.1 to 5.1 or
   higher. This occurs due to an incompatible change in the MyISAM
   table index format in MySQL 5.0. Upgrade from MySQL 4.1 to 5.0 and
   repair all MyISAM tables. Then upgrade from MySQL 5.0 to 5.1 and
   check and repair your tables.

   Modifications to the handling of character sets or collations
   might change the character sort order, which causes the ordering
   of entries in any index that uses an affected character set or
   collation to be incorrect. Such changes result in several possible
   problems:

     * Comparison results that differ from previous results

     * Inability to find some index values due to misordered index
       entries

     * Misordered ORDER BY results

     * Tables that CHECK TABLE reports as being in need of repair

   The solution to these problems is to rebuild any indexes that use
   an affected character set or collation, either by dropping and
   re-creating the indexes, or by dumping and reloading the entire
   table. In some cases, it is possible to alter affected columns to
   use a different collation. For information about rebuilding
   indexes, see Section 2.10.4, "Rebuilding or Repairing Tables or
   Indexes."

   To check whether a table has indexes that must be rebuilt, consult
   the following list. It indicates which versions of MySQL
   introduced character set or collation changes that require indexes
   to be rebuilt. Each entry indicates the version in which the
   change occurred and the character sets or collations that the
   change affects. If the change is associated with a particular bug
   report, the bug number is given.

   The list applies both for binary upgrades and downgrades. For
   example, Bug #27877 was fixed in MySQL 5.1.24, so it applies to
   upgrades from versions older than 5.1.24 to 5.1.24 or newer, and
   to downgrades from 5.1.24 or newer to versions older than 5.1.24.

   In many cases, you can use CHECK TABLE ... FOR UPGRADE to identify
   tables for which index rebuilding is required. It will report this
   message:
Table upgrade required.
Please do "REPAIR TABLE `tbl_name`" or dump/reload to fix it!

   In these cases, you can also use mysqlcheck --check-upgrade or
   mysql_upgrade, which execute CHECK TABLE. However, the use of
   CHECK TABLE applies only after upgrades, not downgrades. Also,
   CHECK TABLE is not applicable to all storage engines. For details
   about which storage engines CHECK TABLE supports, see Section
   13.7.2.2, "CHECK TABLE Syntax."

   These changes cause index rebuilding to be necessary:

     * MySQL 5.1.24 (Bug #27877)
       Affects indexes that use the utf8_general_ci or
       ucs2_general_ci collation for columns that contain 'ß' LATIN
       SMALL LETTER SHARP S (German). The bug fix corrected an error
       in the original collations but introduced an incompatibility
       such that 'ß' compares equal to characters with which it
       previously compared different.
       Affected tables can be detected by CHECK TABLE ... FOR UPGRADE
       as of MySQL 5.1.30 (see Bug #40053).
       A workaround for this issue is implemented as of MySQL 5.1.62,
       5.5.21, and 5.6.5. The workaround involves altering affected
       columns to use the utf8_general_mysql500_ci and
       ucs2_general_mysql500_ci collations, which preserve the
       original pre-5.1.24 ordering of utf8_general_ci and
       ucs2_general_ci.

     * MySQL 5.0.48, 5.1.23 (Bug #27562)
       Affects indexes that use the ascii_general_ci collation for
       columns that contain any of these characters: '`' GRAVE
       ACCENT, '[' LEFT SQUARE BRACKET, '\' REVERSE SOLIDUS, ']'
       RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET, '~' TILDE

2.10.4 Rebuilding or Repairing Tables or Indexes

   This section describes how to rebuild a table, following changes
   to MySQL such as how data types or character sets are handled. For
   example, an error in a collation might have been corrected,
   requiring a table rebuild to update the indexes for character
   columns that use the collation. (For examples, see Section 2.10.3,
   "Checking Whether Tables or Indexes Must Be Rebuilt.") You might
   also need to repair or upgrade a table, as indicated by a table
   check operation such as that performed by CHECK TABLE, mysqlcheck,
   or mysql_upgrade.

   Methods for rebuilding a table include dumping and reloading it,
   or using ALTER TABLE or REPAIR TABLE.
   Note

   If you are rebuilding tables because a different version of MySQL
   will not handle them after a binary (in-place) upgrade or
   downgrade, you must use the dump-and-reload method. Dump the
   tables before upgrading or downgrading using your original version
   of MySQL. Then reload the tables after upgrading or downgrading.

   If you use the dump-and-reload method of rebuilding tables only
   for the purpose of rebuilding indexes, you can perform the dump
   either before or after upgrading or downgrading. Reloading still
   must be done afterward.

   To rebuild a table by dumping and reloading it, use mysqldump to
   create a dump file and mysql to reload the file:
shell> mysqldump db_name t1 > dump.sql
shell> mysql db_name < dump.sql

   To rebuild all the tables in a single database, specify the
   database name without any following table name:
shell> mysqldump db_name > dump.sql
shell> mysql db_name < dump.sql

   To rebuild all tables in all databases, use the --all-databases
   option:
shell> mysqldump --all-databases > dump.sql
shell> mysql < dump.sql

   To rebuild a table with ALTER TABLE, use a "null" alteration; that
   is, an ALTER TABLE statement that "changes" the table to use the
   storage engine that it already has. For example, if t1 is a MyISAM
   table, use this statement:
mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 ENGINE = MyISAM;

   If you are not sure which storage engine to specify in the ALTER
   TABLE statement, use SHOW CREATE TABLE to display the table
   definition.

   If you must rebuild a table because a table checking operation
   indicates that the table is corrupt or needs an upgrade, you can
   use REPAIR TABLE if that statement supports the table's storage
   engine. For example, to repair a MyISAM table, use this statement:
mysql> REPAIR TABLE t1;

   For storage engines such as InnoDB that REPAIR TABLE does not
   support, use mysqldump to create a dump file and mysql to reload
   the file, as described earlier.

   For specifics about which storage engines REPAIR TABLE supports,
   see Section 13.7.2.5, "REPAIR TABLE Syntax."

   mysqlcheck --repair provides command-line access to the REPAIR
   TABLE statement. This can be a more convenient means of repairing
   tables because you can use the --databases or --all-databases
   option to repair all tables in specific databases or all
   databases, respectively:
shell> mysqlcheck --repair --databases db_name ...
shell> mysqlcheck --repair --all-databases

   For incompatibilities introduced in MySQL 5.1.24 by the fix for
   Bug #27877 that corrected the utf8_general_ci and ucs2_general_ci
   collations, a workaround is implemented as of MySQL 5.1.62,
   5.5.21, and 5.6.5. Upgrade to one of those versions, then convert
   each affected table using one of the following methods. In each
   case, the workaround altering affected columns to use the
   utf8_general_mysql500_ci and ucs2_general_mysql500_ci collations,
   which preserve the original pre-5.1.24 ordering of utf8_general_ci
   and ucs2_general_ci.

     * To convert an affected table after a binary upgrade that
       leaves the table files in place, alter the table to use the
       new collation. Suppose that the table t1 contains one or more
       problematic utf8 columns. To convert the table at the table
       level, use a statement like this:
ALTER TABLE t1
CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_mysql500_ci;
       To apply the change on a column-specific basis, use a
       statement like this (be sure to repeat the column definition
       as originally specified except for the COLLATE clause):
ALTER TABLE t1
MODIFY c1 CHAR(N) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_mysql500_ci
;

     * To upgrade the table using a dump and reload procedure, dump
       the table using mysqldump, modify the CREATE TABLE statement
       in the dump file to use the new collation, and reload the
       table.

   After making the appropriate changes, CHECK TABLE should report no
   error.

2.10.5 Copying MySQL Databases to Another Machine

   You can copy the .frm, .MYI, and .MYD files for MyISAM tables
   between different architectures that support the same
   floating-point format. (MySQL takes care of any byte-swapping
   issues.) See Section 14.3, "The MyISAM Storage Engine."

   In cases where you need to transfer databases between different
   architectures, you can use mysqldump to create a file containing
   SQL statements. You can then transfer the file to the other
   machine and feed it as input to the mysql client.

   Use mysqldump --help to see what options are available.

   The easiest (although not the fastest) way to move a database
   between two machines is to run the following commands on the
   machine on which the database is located:
shell> mysqladmin -h 'other_hostname' create db_name
shell> mysqldump db_name | mysql -h 'other_hostname' db_name

   If you want to copy a database from a remote machine over a slow
   network, you can use these commands:
shell> mysqladmin create db_name
shell> mysqldump -h 'other_hostname' --compress db_name | mysql db_na
me

   You can also store the dump in a file, transfer the file to the
   target machine, and then load the file into the database there.
   For example, you can dump a database to a compressed file on the
   source machine like this:
shell> mysqldump --quick db_name | gzip > db_name.gz

   Transfer the file containing the database contents to the target
   machine and run these commands there:
shell> mysqladmin create db_name
shell> gunzip < db_name.gz | mysql db_name

   You can also use mysqldump and mysqlimport to transfer the
   database. For large tables, this is much faster than simply using
   mysqldump. In the following commands, DUMPDIR represents the full
   path name of the directory you use to store the output from
   mysqldump.

   First, create the directory for the output files and dump the
   database:
shell> mkdir DUMPDIR
shell> mysqldump --tab=DUMPDIR db_name

   Then transfer the files in the DUMPDIR directory to some
   corresponding directory on the target machine and load the files
   into MySQL there:
shell> mysqladmin create db_name           # create database
shell> cat DUMPDIR/*.sql | mysql db_name   # create tables in databas
e
shell> mysqlimport db_name DUMPDIR/*.txt   # load data into tables

   Do not forget to copy the mysql database because that is where the
   grant tables are stored. You might have to run commands as the
   MySQL root user on the new machine until you have the mysql
   database in place.

   After you import the mysql database on the new machine, execute
   mysqladmin flush-privileges so that the server reloads the grant
   table information.

2.11 Environment Variables

   This section lists all the environment variables that are used
   directly or indirectly by MySQL. Most of these can also be found
   in other places in this manual.

   Note that any options on the command line take precedence over
   values specified in option files and environment variables, and
   values in option files take precedence over values in environment
   variables.

   In many cases, it is preferable to use an option file instead of
   environment variables to modify the behavior of MySQL. See Section
   4.2.3.3, "Using Option Files."
   Variable Description
   CXX The name of your C++ compiler (for running CMake).
   CC The name of your C compiler (for running CMake).
   DBI_USER The default user name for Perl DBI.
   DBI_TRACE Trace options for Perl DBI.
   HOME The default path for the mysql history file is
   $HOME/.mysql_history.
   LD_RUN_PATH Used to specify the location of libmysqlclient.so.
   LIBMYSQL_ENABLE_CLEARTEXT_PLUGIN Enable mysql_clear_password
   authentication plugin; see Section 6.3.8.7, "The Cleartext
   Client-Side Authentication Plugin."
   LIBMYSQL_PLUGIN_DIR Directory in which to look for client plugins.
   LIBMYSQL_PLUGINS Client plugins to preload.
   MYSQL_DEBUG Debug trace options when debugging.
   MYSQL_GROUP_SUFFIX Option group suffix value (like specifying
   --defaults-group-suffix).
   MYSQL_HISTFILE The path to the mysql history file. If this
   variable is set, its value overrides the default for
   $HOME/.mysql_history.
   MYSQL_HISTIGNORE Patterns specifying statements not to log to
   $HOME/.mysql_history.
   MYSQL_HOME The path to the directory in which the server-specific
   my.cnf file resides.
   MYSQL_HOST The default host name used by the mysql command-line
   client.
   MYSQL_PS1 The command prompt to use in the mysql command-line
   client.
   MYSQL_PWD The default password when connecting to mysqld. Note
   that using this is insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, "End-User
   Guidelines for Password Security."
   MYSQL_TCP_PORT The default TCP/IP port number.
   MYSQL_TEST_LOGIN_FILE The name of the .mylogin.cnf login file.
   MYSQL_UNIX_PORT The default Unix socket file name; used for
   connections to localhost.
   PATH Used by the shell to find MySQL programs.
   TMPDIR The directory where temporary files are created.
   TZ This should be set to your local time zone. See Section
   C.5.4.6, "Time Zone Problems."
   UMASK The user-file creation mode when creating files. See note
   following table.
   UMASK_DIR The user-directory creation mode when creating
   directories. See note following table.
   USER The default user name on Windows when connecting to mysqld.

   For information about the mysql history file, see Section 4.5.1.3,
   "mysql Logging."

   MYSQL_TEST_LOGIN_FILE is the path name of the login file (the file
   created by mysql_config_editor). If not set, the default value is
   %APPDATA%\MySQL\.mylogin.cnf directory on Windows and
   $HOME/.mylogin.cnf on non-Windows systems. See Section 4.6.6,
   "mysql_config_editor --- MySQL Configuration Utility."

   The UMASK and UMASK_DIR variables, despite their names, are used
   as modes, not masks:

     * If UMASK is set, mysqld uses ($UMASK | 0600) as the mode for
       file creation, so that newly created files have a mode in the
       range from 0600 to 0666 (all values octal).

     * If UMASK_DIR is set, mysqld uses ($UMASK_DIR | 0700) as the
       base mode for directory creation, which then is AND-ed with
       ~(~$UMASK & 0666), so that newly created directories have a
       mode in the range from 0700 to 0777 (all values octal). The
       AND operation may remove read and write permissions from the
       directory mode, but not execute permissions.

   MySQL assumes that the value for UMASK or UMASK_DIR is in octal if
   it starts with a zero.

2.12 Perl Installation Notes

   The Perl DBI module provides a generic interface for database
   access. You can write a DBI script that works with many different
   database engines without change. To use DBI, you must install the
   DBI module, as well as a DataBase Driver (DBD) module for each
   type of database server you want to access. For MySQL, this driver
   is the DBD::mysql module.

   Perl, and the DBD::MySQL module for DBI must be installed if you
   want to run the MySQL benchmark scripts; see Section 8.12.2, "The
   MySQL Benchmark Suite."
   Note

   Perl support is not included with MySQL distributions. You can
   obtain the necessary modules from http://search.cpan.org for Unix,
   or by using the ActiveState ppm program on Windows. The following
   sections describe how to do this.

   The DBI/DBD interface requires Perl 5.6.0, and 5.6.1 or later is
   preferred. DBI does not work if you have an older version of Perl.
   You should use DBD::mysql 4.009 or higher. Although earlier
   versions are available, they do not support the full functionality
   of MySQL 5.6.

2.12.1 Installing Perl on Unix

   MySQL Perl support requires that you have installed MySQL client
   programming support (libraries and header files). Most
   installation methods install the necessary files. If you install
   MySQL from RPM files on Linux, be sure to install the developer
   RPM as well. The client programs are in the client RPM, but client
   programming support is in the developer RPM.

   The files you need for Perl support can be obtained from the CPAN
   (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) at http://search.cpan.org.

   The easiest way to install Perl modules on Unix is to use the CPAN
   module. For example:
shell> perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install DBI
cpan> install DBD::mysql

   The DBD::mysql installation runs a number of tests. These tests
   attempt to connect to the local MySQL server using the default
   user name and password. (The default user name is your login name
   on Unix, and ODBC on Windows. The default password is "no
   password.") If you cannot connect to the server with those values
   (for example, if your account has a password), the tests fail. You
   can use force install DBD::mysql to ignore the failed tests.

   DBI requires the Data::Dumper module. It may be installed; if not,
   you should install it before installing DBI.

   It is also possible to download the module distributions in the
   form of compressed tar archives and build the modules manually.
   For example, to unpack and build a DBI distribution, use a
   procedure such as this:

    1. Unpack the distribution into the current directory:
shell> gunzip < DBI-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
       This command creates a directory named DBI-VERSION.

    2. Change location into the top-level directory of the unpacked
       distribution:
shell> cd DBI-VERSION

    3. Build the distribution and compile everything:
shell> perl Makefile.PL
shell> make
shell> make test
shell> make install

   The make test command is important because it verifies that the
   module is working. Note that when you run that command during the
   DBD::mysql installation to exercise the interface code, the MySQL
   server must be running or the test fails.

   It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the DBD::mysql
   distribution whenever you install a new release of MySQL. This
   ensures that the latest versions of the MySQL client libraries are
   installed correctly.

   If you do not have access rights to install Perl modules in the
   system directory or if you want to install local Perl modules, the
   following reference may be useful:
   http://servers.digitaldaze.com/extensions/perl/modules.html#module
   s

   Look under the heading "Installing New Modules that Require
   Locally Installed Modules."

2.12.2 Installing ActiveState Perl on Windows

   On Windows, you should do the following to install the MySQL DBD
   module with ActiveState Perl:

    1. Get ActiveState Perl from
       http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/ and install
       it.

    2. Open a console window.

    3. If necessary, set the HTTP_proxy variable. For example, you
       might try a setting like this:
C:\> set HTTP_proxy=my.proxy.com:3128

    4. Start the PPM program:
C:\> C:\perl\bin\ppm.pl

    5. If you have not previously done so, install DBI:
ppm> install DBI

    6. If this succeeds, run the following command:
ppm> install DBD-mysql

   This procedure should work with ActiveState Perl 5.6 or newer.

   If you cannot get the procedure to work, you should install the
   ODBC driver instead and connect to the MySQL server through ODBC:
use DBI;
$dbh= DBI->connect("DBI:ODBC:$dsn",$user,$password) ||
  die "Got error $DBI::errstr when connecting to $dsn\n";

2.12.3 Problems Using the Perl DBI/DBD Interface

   If Perl reports that it cannot find the ../mysql/mysql.so module,
   the problem is probably that Perl cannot locate the
   libmysqlclient.so shared library. You should be able to fix this
   problem by one of the following methods:

     * Copy libmysqlclient.so to the directory where your other
       shared libraries are located (probably /usr/lib or /lib).

     * Modify the -L options used to compile DBD::mysql to reflect
       the actual location of libmysqlclient.so.

     * On Linux, you can add the path name of the directory where
       libmysqlclient.so is located to the /etc/ld.so.conf file.

     * Add the path name of the directory where libmysqlclient.so is
       located to the LD_RUN_PATH environment variable. Some systems
       use LD_LIBRARY_PATH instead.

   Note that you may also need to modify the -L options if there are
   other libraries that the linker fails to find. For example, if the
   linker cannot find libc because it is in /lib and the link command
   specifies -L/usr/lib, change the -L option to -L/lib or add -L/lib
   to the existing link command.

   If you get the following errors from DBD::mysql, you are probably
   using gcc (or using an old binary compiled with gcc):
/usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__moddi3'
/usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__divdi3'

   Add -L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/... -lgcc to the link command when the
   mysql.so library gets built (check the output from make for
   mysql.so when you compile the Perl client). The -L option should
   specify the path name of the directory where libgcc.a is located
   on your system.

   Another cause of this problem may be that Perl and MySQL are not
   both compiled with gcc. In this case, you can solve the mismatch
   by compiling both with gcc.
