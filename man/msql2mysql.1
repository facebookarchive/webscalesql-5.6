.SH "NAME"
msql2mysql \- convert mSQL programs for use with MySQL
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBmsql2mysql\fR\fB\fIC\-source\-file\fR\fR\fB\ \&.\&.\&.\fR\ 'u
\fBmsql2mysql\fR\fB\fIC\-source\-file\fR\fR\fB \&.\&.\&.\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Initially, the MySQL C API was developed to be very similar to that for the mSQL database system\&. Because of this, mSQL programs often can be converted relatively easily for use with MySQL by changing the names of the C API functions\&.
.PP
The
\fBmsql2mysql\fR
utility performs the conversion of mSQL C API function calls to their MySQL equivalents\&.
\fBmsql2mysql\fR
converts the input file in place, so make a copy of the original before converting it\&. For example, use
\fBmsql2mysql\fR
like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBcp client\-prog\&.c client\-prog\&.c\&.orig\fR
shell> \fBmsql2mysql client\-prog\&.c\fR
client\-prog\&.c converted
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Then examine
client\-prog\&.c
and make any post\-conversion revisions that may be necessary\&.
.PP
\fBmsql2mysql\fR
uses the
\fBreplace\fR
utility to make the function name substitutions\&. See
\fBreplace\fR(1)\&.
