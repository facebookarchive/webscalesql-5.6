.SH "NAME"
mysql.server \- MySQL server startup script
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBmysql\ {start|stop}\fR\ 'u
\fBmysql {start|stop}\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
MySQL distributions on Unix include a script named
\fBmysql\&.server\fR\&. It can be used on systems such as Linux and Solaris that use System V\-style run directories to start and stop system services\&. It is also used by the Mac OS X Startup Item for MySQL\&.
.PP
\fBmysql\&.server\fR
can be found in the
support\-files
directory under your MySQL installation directory or in a MySQL source distribution\&.
.PP
If you use the Linux server RPM package (MySQL\-server\-\fIVERSION\fR\&.rpm), the
\fBmysql\&.server\fR
script will be installed in the
/etc/init\&.d
directory with the name
mysql\&. You need not install it manually\&. See
Section\ \&2.5.1, \(lqInstalling MySQL from RPM Packages on Linux\(rq, for more information on the Linux RPM packages\&.
.PP
Some vendors provide RPM packages that install a startup script under a different name such as
\fBmysqld\fR\&.
.PP
If you install MySQL from a source distribution or using a binary distribution format that does not install
\fBmysql\&.server\fR
automatically, you can install it manually\&. Instructions are provided in
Section\ \&2.10.1.2, \(lqStarting and Stopping MySQL Automatically\(rq\&.
.PP
\fBmysql\&.server\fR
reads options from the
[mysql\&.server]
and
[mysqld]
sections of option files\&. For backward compatibility, it also reads
[mysql_server]
sections, although you should rename such sections to
[mysql\&.server]
when using MySQL 5\&.6\&.
.PP
\fBmysql\&.server\fR
supports the following options\&.
