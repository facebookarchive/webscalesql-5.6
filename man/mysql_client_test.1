.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBmysql_client_test\fR
program is used for testing aspects of the MySQL client API that cannot be tested using
\fBmysqltest\fR
and its test language\&.
\fBmysql_client_test_embedded\fR
is similar but used for testing the embedded server\&. Both programs are run as part of the test suite\&.
.PP
The source code for the programs can be found in in
tests/mysql_client_test\&.c
in a source distribution\&. The program serves as a good source of examples illustrating how to use various features of the client API\&.
.PP
\fBmysql_client_test\fR
is used in a test by the same name in the main tests suite of
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
but may also be run directly\&. Unlike the other programs listed here, it does not read an external description of what tests to run\&. Instead, all tests are coded into the program, which is written to cover all aspects of the C language API\&.
