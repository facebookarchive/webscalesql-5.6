.SH "NAME"
mysql_plugin \- configure MySQL server plugins
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBmysql_plugin\ [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\ \fR\fB\fIplugin\fR\fR\fB\ {ENABLE|DISABLE}\fR\ 'u
\fBmysql_plugin [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] \fR\fB\fIplugin\fR\fR\fB {ENABLE|DISABLE}\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBmysql_plugin\fR
utility enables MySQL administrators to manage which plugins a MySQL server loads\&. It provides an alternative to manually specifying the
\fB\-\-plugin\-load\fR
option at server startup or using the
INSTALL PLUGIN
and
UNINSTALL PLUGIN
statements at runtime\&.
\fBmysql_plugin\fR
is available as of MySQL 5\&.6\&.3\&.
.PP
Depending on whether
\fBmysql_plugin\fR
is invoked to enable or disable plugins, it inserts or deletes rows in the
mysql\&.plugin
table that serves as a plugin registry\&. (To perform this operation,
\fBmysql_plugin\fR
invokes the MySQL server in bootstrap mode\&. This means that the server must not already be running\&.) For normal server startups, the server loads and enables plugins listed in
mysql\&.plugin
automatically\&. For additional control over plugin activation, use
\fB\-\-\fR\fB\fIplugin_name\fR\fR
options named for specific plugins, as described in
Section\ \&5.1.8.1, \(lqInstalling and Uninstalling Plugins\(rq\&.
.PP
Each invocation of
\fBmysql_plugin\fR
reads a configuration file to determine how to configure the plugins contained in a single plugin library object file\&. To invoke
\fBmysql_plugin\fR, use this syntax:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
mysql_plugin [\fIoptions\fR] \fIplugin\fR {ENABLE|DISABLE}
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fIplugin\fR
is the name of the plugin to configure\&.
ENABLE
or
DISABLE
(not case sensitive) specify whether to enable or disable components of the plugin library named in the configuration file\&. The order of the
\fIplugin\fR
and
ENABLE
or
DISABLE
arguments does not matter\&.
.PP
For example, to configure components of a plugin library file named
myplugins\&.so
on Linux or
myplugins\&.dll
on Windows, specify a
\fIplugin\fR
value of
myplugins\&. Suppose that this plugin library contains three plugins,
plugin1,
plugin2, and
plugin3, all of which should be configured under
\fBmysql_plugin\fR
control\&. By convention, configuration files have a suffix of
\&.ini
and the same basename as the plugin library, so the default configuration file name for this plugin library is
myplugins\&.ini\&. The configuration file contents look like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
myplugins
plugin1
plugin2
plugin3
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The first line in the
myplugins\&.ini
file is the name of the library object file, without any extension such as
\&.so
or
\&.dll\&. The remaining lines are the names of the components to be enabled or disabled\&. Each value in the file should be on a separate line\&. Lines on which the first character is
\*(Aq#\*(Aq
are taken as comments and ignored\&.
.PP
To enable the plugins listed in the configuration file, invoke
\fBmysql_plugin\fR
this way:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_plugin myplugins ENABLE\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To disable the plugins, use
DISABLE
rather than
ENABLE\&.
.PP
An error occurs if
\fBmysql_plugin\fR
cannot find the configuration file or plugin library file, or if
\fBmysql_plugin\fR
cannot start the MySQL server\&.
.PP
\fBmysql_plugin\fR
supports the following options, which can be specified on the command line or in the
[mysqld]
group of any option file\&. For options specified in a
[mysqld]
group,
\fBmysql_plugin\fR
recognizes the
\fB\-\-basedir\fR,
\fB\-\-datadir\fR, and
\fB\-\-plugin\-dir\fR
options and ignores others\&. For information about option files, see
Section\ \&4.2.3.3, \(lqUsing Option Files\(rq\&.
