.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The MySQL slow query log contains information about queries that take a long time to execute (see
Section\ \&5.2.5, \(lqThe Slow Query Log\(rq)\&.
\fBmysqldumpslow\fR
parses MySQL slow query log files and prints a summary of their contents\&.
.PP
Normally,
\fBmysqldumpslow\fR
groups queries that are similar except for the particular values of number and string data values\&. It
\(lqabstracts\(rq
these values to
N
and
\*(AqS\*(Aq
when displaying summary output\&. The
\fB\-a\fR
and
\fB\-n\fR
options can be used to modify value abstracting behavior\&.
