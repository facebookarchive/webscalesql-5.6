.PP
\fBndb_waiter\fR
repeatedly (each 100 milliseconds) prints out the status of all cluster data nodes until either the cluster reaches a given status or the
\fB\-\-timeout\fR
limit is exceeded, then exits\&. By default, it waits for the cluster to achieve
STARTED
status, in which all nodes have started and connected to the cluster\&. This can be overridden using the
\fB\-\-no\-contact\fR
and
\fB\-\-not\-started\fR
options\&.
.PP
The node states reported by this utility are as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
UNKNOWN: The node can be contacted, but its status is not yet known\&. Usually, this means that the node has received a
START
or
RESTART
command from the management server, but has not yet acted on it\&.

.RS 4

RESTART
command\&.
