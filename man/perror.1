.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBperror\ [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\ \fR\fB\fIerrorcode\fR\fR\fB\ \&.\&.\&.\fR\ 'u
\fBperror [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] \fR\fB\fIerrorcode\fR\fR\fB \&.\&.\&.\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
For most system errors, MySQL displays, in addition to an internal text message, the system error code in one of the following styles:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
message \&.\&.\&. (errno: #)
message \&.\&.\&. (Errcode: #)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
You can find out what the error code means by examining the documentation for your system or by using the
\fBperror\fR
utility\&.
.PP
\fBperror\fR
prints a description for a system error code or for a storage engine (table handler) error code\&.
.PP
Invoke
\fBperror\fR
like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBperror [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] \fR\fB\fIerrorcode\fR\fR\fB \&.\&.\&.\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBperror 13 64\fR
OS error code  13:  Permission denied
OS error code  64:  Machine is not on the network
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To obtain the error message for a MySQL Cluster error code, invoke
\fBperror\fR
with the
\fB\-\-ndb\fR
option:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBperror \-\-ndb \fR\fB\fIerrorcode\fR\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note that the meaning of system error messages may be dependent on your operating system\&. A given error code may mean different things on different operating systems\&.
.PP
\fBperror\fR
supports the following options\&.
.sp
.RS 4

\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
